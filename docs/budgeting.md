## Basic Rules
The [50/30/20 rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/dkhs1k/personal_finance_guide/#lightbox) is a simple budgeting method to help stay in control of your personal finances and ensure money is set aside until retirement. The ratios are a suggestion, and everyone will have different budgeting requirements. 

- The rule states that after tax income should be allocated as follows:
	- 50% for needs
	- 30% for financial goals (savings and investments)
		- This allocation is primarily determined by what age an investor starts and the planned retirement age. It may be half or more than double depending on your income, goals and timeframe.
		- A rule of thumb for savings is to have somewhere between 3-12 months worth of readily available, i.e. liquid, emergency living expenses in a FDIC or NCUA insured high yield savings account or money market fund. The primary consideration for the length of savings is job stability.
		- After savings are met, all future income in this group gets invested.
	- 20% for wants
- The [Prime Directive flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpeg) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) will be mentioned throughout this site as a helpful guide for those new to financial planning. Whenever things start seeming too complex or you haven't quite figured out your overall plan yet, refer to the flowchart to help you set your sights straight again.

That's it. Hopefully the categories can be adjusted to put more towards financial goals sooner than later. For anyone thinking of waiting to start investing for retirement, time is the enemy when it comes to compounding. Saving is not investing, but it takes a [saving](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/1dipsve/a_cool_guide_for_saving_money/#lightbox) mindset to have money to invest. The more conservative a person can be with spending in the early years of investing, the more money can be put toward compounding, where money literally earns more money without requiring any input from the investor. This is the key to becoming financially independent - let the money work for you. Do not leave more money than is needed for emergencies or planned purchases in checking or savings accounts. The devaluation of currency and inflation will reduce the future purchasing power of savings unless it is invested for a better return than the inflation rate.

If debt is a concern, spend some time comparing the earning potential of investing earned income versus [paying down existing debt](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Paying_down_loans_versus_investing). In general, the expected rate of return from investing can be compared to the interest rate on the debt. However, allowed deductions, credits, etc. need to be considered as well. Compound growth and debt management [calculators](resources/tools.md#debt-management)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> can help figure this out. The expected rate of return will covered in the next section.

Most people have heard the expression [*living below your means*](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Living_below_your_means). It is often used in a negative context when people realize (with regret) that they will need to start giving up things they do not necessarily need. For the wise investor, the intent of the expression could be better understood as living with needs efficiently satisfied, while giving oneself an occasional luxury, and having the freedom to use leftover income for investing. This way, the wise investor is poised for their living expectations during retirement and anything they are able to enjoy beyond this is a bonus. Life only gets more difficult. Make good decisions now so any future difficulties are better prepared for.

One of the best habits to learn early on is to invest pay raises. This accomplishes three things: it adjusts investment deposits to keep up with inflation, puts more money to work compounding and prevents lifestyle inflation<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. As you will learn, some investments penalize early withdrawal, and others will be only be subject to various tax rules. So, it does matter where money is invested if it might be needed before retirement, but the most important thing is to begin earning compound returns with the peace of mind it can still be accessed if needed, e.g., starting a business, paying for a large unexpected expense, helping others, etc. However, it is almost never recommended to remove money from an account subject to penalty or one with current or potential good returns in the near future. It is much easier for people to leave an investment in place than it is to replenish it, and loan interest is usually cheaper than the long-term rate of return from the stock market.

Lastly, an opinion on budgeting methods. A budget is simply a spending plan for every dollar of income. In other words it is an allocation plan for how to put every dollar to good use. The less places dollars are allocated, the simpler the plan is. Nothing is simpler than not paying for things you do not need. Needs are the *reasonable living necessities and accommodations one must have to earn a living and enjoy life with loved ones*. Building wealth is not solely about wage or salary levels, but rather what kind of payback do investments provide after spending the purchasing capital (money, tradeable goods, time, etc.). Everyone needs food, but what is the most time and cost efficient way to stay fed? It may surprise some people that meal prepping at home can be comparatively time efficient to picking up meals when compared over a long-term period of time. The key is adequate storage space for the ingredients, meals and leftovers to reduce trips to the grocery store, and having a machine that can do most of the cleaning. One of the biggest factors that determines the return on our time investments is how we use the internet. Does your use of time on the internet provide a negative return on investment? 

Sometimes investing more time than is necessary into something can be beneficial too, like riding a bicycle to run errands within reasonable distance, which pays personal health returns. Be diligent to stay on the lookout for ways to not only spend less money, but how to better invest the most valuable resourceâ€”time. When you are able to free up more time, try to spend a larger portion of it routinely learning, creating, and reaching small goals than is spent on leisure and relaxing.

One of the must valuable budgeting lessons you can learn is to consider your spending in relation to your real hourly wage, a concept made famous by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez, the authors of Your Money or Your Life. A real hourly wage takes into account how much money you earn for the total amount of time put into something. This incudes time spent preparing to go to work and unwind, commuting, and all other associated time and monetary expenses. A key to achieving financial goals is to breakdown and simplify things into easily understandable parts as much as you can.
