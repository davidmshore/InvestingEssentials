**## Basic Rules
The [50/30/20 rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/dkhs1k/personal_finance_guide/#lightbox) is a simple budgeting method to help stay in control of personal finances and ensure money is set aside until retirement. The ratios are only a suggestion, and everyone will have different budgeting requirements. 

- The rule states that after tax income should be allocated as follows:
	- 50% for needs
	- 30% for financial goals (savings and investments)
		- A rule of thumb is to have somewhere between 3-6 months worth of emergency living expenses in readily available, i.e. liquid, savings.
	- 20% for wants

That's it. Those are the three categories, and hopefully they can be adjusted to put more towards financial goals. For anyone thinking of waiting to start investing for retirement, time is the enemy when it comes to compounding. Saving is not investing, but it takes a [saving](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/1dipsve/a_cool_guide_for_saving_money/#lightbox) mindset to have money to invest. The more conservative a person can be with spending in the early years of investing, the more money can be put toward compounding, where money literally earns more money without requiring any input from the investor. This is the key to becoming financially independent - let the money work for you. Do not leave more money than is needed for emergencies or planned purchases in checking or savings accounts. Inflation will devalue savings unless it is invested for a better return than the inflation rate.

If debt is a concern, then invest some time comparing the rate of return on investing any leftover working income versus paying down the principle on existing debt and find out which use of the discretionary income will result in a having more money in the end. There are compound growth and debt management calculators to help figure this out.

Most people have heard the expression *living below your means*. It is often used in a negative context when people regrettably realize that they will need to start giving up things they do not necessarily need. For the wise investor, the intent of the expression could be better understood as living with needs efficiently satisfied, while giving oneself an occasional luxury, and having the freedom to use leftover income for investing. This way, the wise investor is poised for their living expectations during retirement by having lived a lifestyle that considered anything beyond the necessities as a bonus. Life only gets more difficult, make good decisions now, so any future difficulties are better prepared for.

One of the best habits to learn early on is to invest pay raises. This accomplishes two things: it puts more money to work compounding and prevents lifestyle creep<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. As you will learn, some investments penalize early withdrawal, while others will be subject to various tax rules. So, it does matter where money is invested if it might be needed before retirement, but the important part is that it can begin earning compound returns and still be accessed if needed, e.g., starting a business, a large unexpected expense, helping others, etc.

Lastly, an opinion on budgeting methods. Nothing is simpler than not paying for things you do not need. Building wealth is not solely about wage or salary levels, but rather what kind of payback does an investment provide after the purchasing capital (money, tradeable assets, etc.) is spent. Everyone needs food, but what is the most time and cost efficient way to stay fed? It may surprise some people that meal prepping at home can be comparatively time efficient to picking up premade meals when comparing over a longer timeframe. As long as there is adequate storage space for ingredients, meals and leftovers to reduce trips to the grocery store, and especially when a machine can do most of the cleaning. Do you need internet? Yes, but do you invest more time using the internet in ways that provide a negative return on investment? Think about ways to not only spend less money, but how to better invest the most valuable resource, time.
