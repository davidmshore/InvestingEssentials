## Budgeting Apps
- A budgeting app makes creating and maintaining a spending, savings and investing plan simple and easy. Some of them integrate with your credit card services to automatically update the spending entries.
- [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) receives positive reviews for being different from other budgeting methods. Here is a list of the [alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1dssll4/alternatives/) and a [search of Clark.com](https://clark.com/search/?q=budgeting+apps#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=budgeting-apps&gsc.page=1) that provides pros and cons for their top rated options.
## Password Managers and Internet Security
- It is recommended to setup and become fluent with using a secure password manager to keep track of important accounts, ensure that secure passwords are used (25+ random alphanumeric characters and symbols) and that no passwords are reused. The most secure types are offline managers, such as [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), but managers that store encrypted user data online and never receive sensitive data unencrypted from the user are an acceptable choice. Only consider companies with a good track record that has been verified via third party audits.
- It is also a good idea to use a dedicated email account that is only used for important accounts, such as the password manager and financial accounts.
- [Password Bits](https://passwordbits.com/) is a helpful website for computer and internet security.
## Calculators

### Bond Calculators
- [Bond Calculator](https://www.fncalculator.com/financialcalculator?type=bondCalculator) (fncalculator.com)
- [I-Bonds](https://eyebonds.info/ibonds/index.html) (eyebonds.info)

	- Assumes using the standard deduction.
- A spreadsheet exported from your broker is usually the most practical way to calculate and ensure accuracy.
### Compound Growth (General)
- There are calculators that compute simple compound growth, there are market data backtesting calculators, and then there are calculators that attempt to predict the future performance of an asset. Since past performance is not a guarantee of the future, the latter type should be used with the recognition they are at best averaging and randomizing lots of past data.
	- [Maturity value including expense ratio for ETFs and Mutual Funds](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/expense-ratio) (reverse CAGR)

### Retirement Calculators
#### Conversions
- Since IRAs are subject to ordinary income tax rates, [conversion](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bfmq1t/roth_ira_conversion_taxes/) from a pre-tax to post-tax account will always incur at least federal, if not also state tax.
