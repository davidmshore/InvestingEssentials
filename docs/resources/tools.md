## Budgeting Apps
- A budgeting app makes creating and maintaining a spending, savings and investing plan simple and easy. Some of them integrate with credit card services to automatically update spending entries.
- [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) receives positive reviews for being different from other budgeting methods. Here is a list of the [alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1dssll4/alternatives/) from Reddit and a [search result from Clark.com](https://clark.com/search/?q=budgeting+apps#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=budgeting-apps&gsc.page=1)—the latest article should list the pros and cons of their top rated options.
## Password Managers and Internet Security
- Setting up a secure password manager to keep track of important accounts ensures that secure passwords are used (25+ random alphanumeric characters and symbols). Some managers can check if passwords are accidentally being reused. The most secure types are offline managers, such as [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), but managers that store encrypted user data online and never receive sensitive data unencrypted from the user are an acceptable choice. Only consider companies with a good track record that has been verified via third party audits.
- It is also a good idea to use a dedicated email account that is only used for important accounts, such as the password manager and financial accounts.
- [Password Bits](https://passwordbits.com/) is a helpful website for computer and internet security.
## Calculators

### Bond Calculators

	- Assumes the standard deduction is used.
- A spreadsheet exported from your broker is usually the most practical way to calculate and ensure accuracy.
### Compound Growth (General)
- There are calculators that compute simple compound growth, there are market data backtesting calculators, and then there are calculators that attempt to predict the future performance of an asset. Since past performance is not a guarantee of the future, the latter type should be used with the recognition that they are at best averaging and randomizing lots of past data.
	- [Maturity value including expense ratio for ETFs and Mutual Funds](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/expense-ratio) (reverse CAGR)
	- [Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)](https://cagrcalculator.net/)

### Retirement Calculators
#### Conversions
- Since IRAs are subject to ordinary income tax rates, [conversion](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bfmq1t/roth_ira_conversion_taxes/) from a pre-tax to post-tax account will always incur at least federal, if not also state tax.

## Charting
- Brokerage firms offer their own tools and there are hundreds of other websites and platforms to choose from as well. [BarChart](https://www.barchart.com/) and [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) are two well known services that offer a good selection of tools to choose from without having to login. Both offer free accounts to remove annoying popups. Enter a ticker, set a duration and drag the chart to a starting point to see the percentage change over time. If the ticker is available on [FinViz](https://finviz.com/), the breakdown of a fund is nicely displayed. Comparing multiple tickers on [BarChart](https://www.barchart.com/my/compare-stocks) and [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/compare/) is very easy.
