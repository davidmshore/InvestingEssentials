If you feel like you are understanding things, but still not quite putting it all together in your brain, or you would like to introduce others to the idea of responsible living and financial planning, check out some of the other resources along with sharing this site. Most of these are free options, but sometimes books offer a more systematic and thorough learning experience than what is freely available online.

Amazon and Goodreads are probably the best ways to filter for ease of understanding and level of advice via their ratings and reviews.

Financial planning tools are grouped by category [here](tools.md)<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->.
## Reading and Text-to-Speech Tools
There are a number of tools to help visually impaired readers that can aid anyone consuming digital content, including [text-to-speech tools](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/best-text-to-speech-tools) which can read most on-screen text aloud. These range from built-in OS features to application extensions or plugins to machine learning powered apps.

- [Natural Reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/) and [Voice Reader](https://thereadme.com/install/) are free Chrome extensions with decent quality voices and options to adjust reading speed, text highlighting, and text selection.
- Of the integrated Accessibility features on Android devices available as of 2024, such as TalkBack, Select to Speak or Reading mode, [Reading mode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.accessibility.reader&hl=en-US) is probably the most useful for reading long form text plus it offers text-to-speech. Downloading the app adds a feature in the device's Accessibility settings. When enabled, the feature can be triggered by a swipe gesture or screen shortcut. It may not work with all apps, such as Kindle. The visual benefit alone might be worth it for readers who prefer larger on-screen text as well as the removal of ads and noise from busy websites. If the default text-to-speech engine is not a desired voice, downloads might be available. Reading mode can be downloaded from Google Play.
- Most browsers include a built-in option to declutter website articles via a document icon in the browser search bar.
	- Chrome browser's reading mode may be tucked away in an overflow menu, and it may not be enabled by default. It is easy enough to enable following these [instructions](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-reading-mode-2-3354627/). The instructions should work on Android or iOS.

For a dedicated free mobile reading app with excellent text-to-speech, Reader by ElevenLabs is a powerful app that offers a variety of high quality AI voices to read any document or book that has been downloaded to a device in a compatible format. It is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.elevenlabs.readerapp&hl=en-US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reader-by-elevenlabs/id6479373050).

Financial topics can be dry reading. The right author and style of book can make the big difference between a book you stay interested in versus one that will primarily be used for reference. The more you build your foundational understanding, the easier listening will become without the need for things like charts to visualize concepts for you.
## Blogs
- [Crown.org](https://wwwcrown.org/)
	- Crown Financial Ministries was established in the 1970s with the goal of applying biblical principles of responsible money management. The website is set up like a blog and covers various life decisions involving money. Resources include a podcast and a few paid courses for people who prefer a guided path or assistance in passing financial knowledge on to the next generation. Some notable biblical proverbs on wise investing: 
		- Proverbs 6:6-8 Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, which, having no captain, overseer or ruler, prepares her food in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest.
		- Proverbs 21:5 - The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance and advantage, but everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty.
		- Proverbs 21:20 - There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise [who prepare for the future], But a short-sighted _and_ foolish man swallows it up _and_ wastes it.
		- Proverbs 27:23 - Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, attend to your herds.

### Digital and Audiobooks
- The local library usually has some of the recommendations listed in the links above including digital versions. Audiobooks are great if you spend time commuting or just don't have much time to read. Most county libraries provide free access to third party digital libraries for simply being a member. These services can be found on a library's website. Digital libraries still rely on the availability of books for *checkout*, and usually give the user a certain number of checkouts per month before being automatically returned unless renewed by the user. Many of the titles are also available as audiobooks.
- Archive.org is another great place to look for free books. If books can be found they might be available for download in various formats. For example, the first edition of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) PDF can be read online or [downloaded](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up?q=bogleheads%5C%27) in common reading formats. Downloading is recommended, since the future availability of uploaded content is unknown. 
- Sometimes converting to other formats may be desired so the media can be opened with a particular app. [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is a powerful desktop application that can convert to just about any format. 
### From The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing
#### Summarized Portfolio Characteristics and Investing Tips
Criteria may or may not apply to an investor's strategy and may apply at different periods throughout the life of an investor:

- Avoid managed accounts. The fees may not sound like much, but they reduce the amount of capital available for compound growth. This can amount to years worth of retirement income, which will result in the investor either having to reduce their standard of retirement living or work longer to save up additional income. Instead, invest in low cost index funds.
- Financial advisors are a valuable resource—especially early on for coming up with a plan that aligns with your retirement goals—but consider the fee structure an advisor uses. If seeking professional help, look for a certified financial planner that offers their service on a flat fee or time-based price structure. This way the exchange for their time is of more equal value than paying an annual commission for your money to sit in an investment account that will likely be semi-automated for the average investor.
- Avoid tax drag. Generally accomplished through the use of tax advantaged accounts. This can become more nuanced if an investor plans to retire early and must understand SEPP rules and possibly utilize income from other sources of income. 
	- Use tax advantaged accounts. 401K, 403b, IRAs, etc. There many different options for workers and their spouses through company plans.
- Least tax efficient funds<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> in tax advantaged account.
- Most tax efficient funds in taxable account.
	- Use tax efficient index funds.
	- Keep turnover low, try to buy funds that last forever to avoid taxable events (turnover rate needs to be over one year to take advantage of long term capital gains for capital invested in taxable brokerage accounts).
	- Funds having the fewest dividend assets.
	- Low dividend yield funds.
	- Qualified dividends are more tax efficient than ordinary dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed as long term capital gains rather than ordinary income.
	- Stocks with qualified dividends are better placed in taxable accounts, while stocks with ordinary dividend yields, which are taxed as ordinary income, are better placed in tax advantaged accounts.
- There is a list of estimated least tax efficient to most tax efficient assets on [page 140](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) of the book (PDF page 167).
- Assuming that when comparing funds to invest in, each are equally diversified, the expense ratio is the #1 indicator of how well a fund will perform over time.
- Morningstar.com provides a tax cost ratio of 3, 5, 10, and 15 year periods.
- 401(k) plan details about fees and expenses are provided in Summary Plan Descriptions. Form 5500 does not show individual account expenses, but additional documents may be requested from an employer about how much they are paying.
	- 401(k) plans may not offer the lowest cost investing options, but they are usually still the best retirement account to max out first up to the employer match, if a generous employer match is offered. 
- Use the prospectus for potential investments to confirm the performance and expenses associated with it.
- Use tax harvesting in taxable accounts, meaning take advantage of lower income years when the sale of securities for a gain will result in lower, or zero taxes, and/or selling securities at a loss can help offset capital gains tax. Then either wait 31 days to repurchase the same or substantially similar securities or purchase dissimilar ones to avoid a wash sale<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> and be careful that automatic reinvestment of dividends does not trigger a wash sale. This practice effectively increases the cost basis (original purchase price of an asset) so that tax on future capital gains of the same securities will be lower. The median portfolio that used loss harvesting added about 20% to its value over what purely passive investing did.
- Use HIFO (highest in, first out), which is removing the assets that have shown the least returns or highest loss from an account, when trying to minimize taxes. This is possible through specific identification of shares.
- Buy fund shares after the distribution date (the date when annual taxable distributions are paid).
- Sell fund shares before the distribution date.
- Sell profitable shares after the new year if tax harvesting allows it (generally, there is no sense paying taxes earlier than needed).
- Regarding bonds, as of the publishing of the book in 2014, it is advised to use a bond advisor due to deceptive restricted clauses and hidden fees in certain bond types (e.g., corporate bonds). An exception would be using treasurydirect.com that offers direct issues of US government bonds to end users.
- Avoid timing the market and contribute earned income on a scheduled basis.
- Be prepared to pass on assets by having legal instructions written up in a will or trust.
