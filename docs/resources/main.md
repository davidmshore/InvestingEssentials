If you are comprehending the concepts to help you reach your financial goals, but still not quite putting it all together, or if you would like to introduce others to financial planning, check out some of the resources below along with sharing this site. If you would like to share the gist of the ideas covered so far, Humphrey Yang presents it well in this 15 minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myQ05BO9pYM). Most of the options below are free. However, books may offer a more systematic and thorough learning experience than what is freely available online.

Amazon and Goodreads are probably the best ways to filter for ease of understanding and level of advice via their ratings and reviews.

Financial planning tools are grouped by category [here](tools.md)<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->.
## Blogs
- [Crown.org](https://wwwcrown.org/)
	- Crown Financial Ministries was established in the 1970s with the goal of applying biblical principles of responsible money management. The website is set up like a blog and covers various life decisions involving money. Resources include a podcast and a few paid courses for people who prefer a guided path or assistance in passing financial knowledge on to the next generation. Some notable biblical proverbs that apply to investing: 
		- Proverbs 6:6-8 - Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, which, having no captain, overseer or ruler, prepares her food in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest.
		- Proverbs 21:5 - The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance and advantage, but everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty.
		- Proverbs 21:20 - There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise [who prepare for the future], But a short-sighted _and_ foolish man swallows it up _and_ wastes it.
		- Proverbs 27:23 - Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, attend to your herds.
- [JLCollinSNH.com](https://jlcollinsnh.com/)
	- A little dated, but sound advice nonetheless. The blog also covers topics such as career advice.

				- Lots of graphs help visualize learning.

## Books
- [The Bogleheads' Recommendations](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up)
	- Listed by investor experience level, see page 279 (PDF page 306).
- [YourMoneyOrYourLife.com -> Resources](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/resources/) -> Financial Independence Books
	- [Key points](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7d0rtt/takeaways_from_your_money_or_your_life_book_review/) from Your Money or Your Life, the [official summary](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book-summary/), and [additional summaries/reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/99p39l/my_most_recent_read_your_money_or_your_life_by/).
- [r/financialindependence -> Wiki -> Books](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/books/)
- [r/leanfire -> Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/wiki/index/) -> Reading List
- See also [**Reading financial books is a waste of time.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/y9eyu1/reading_financial_books_is_a_waste_of_time/) (r/financialindependence) and [**Whole Book Summaries**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/10koygj/whole_book_summaries/) by Redditor captmorgan50.
	- With all of the freely available information found online, I still recommend reading and owning at least one book on financial planning/fiscal responsibility and one on investing. A good author can help readers retain the abundance of topics that people are bound to come across, and possessing a book allows you to annotate, bookmark and refresh yourself on topics as life changes.
### Digital and Audiobooks
- The local library usually has some of the recommendations listed in the links above including digital versions. Audiobooks are great if you spend time commuting or just don't have much time to read. Most county libraries provide free access to third party digital libraries for simply being a member. These services can be found on a library's website. Digital libraries still rely on the availability of books for *checkout*, and usually give the user a certain number of checkouts per month before being automatically returned unless renewed by the user. Many of the titles are also available as audiobooks.
- Archive.org might have a few of the books mentioned. The first edition of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) can be read online or [downloaded](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up?q=bogleheads%5C%27) in common reading formats. Downloading is recommended, since the future availability of uploaded content is unknown. 
- Sometimes converting to other formats may be desired so the media can be opened with a particular app. [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is a powerful desktop application that can convert to just about any format.

## Reading and Text-to-Speech Tools
There are a number of tools to help visually impaired readers that can aid anyone consuming digital content, including [text-to-speech tools](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/best-text-to-speech-tools) which can read most on-screen text aloud. These range from built-in OS features to application extensions or plugins to machine learning powered apps.

- [Natural Reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/) and [Voice Reader](https://thereadme.com/install/) are free Chrome extensions with decent quality voices and options to adjust reading speed, text highlighting, and text selection.
- Of the integrated Accessibility features on Android devices, such as TalkBack, Select to Speak or Reading mode, [Reading mode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.accessibility.reader&hl=en-US) is probably the most useful for reading long form text plus it offers text-to-speech. Downloading the app adds a feature in the device's Accessibility settings. When enabled, the feature can be triggered by a swipe gesture or screen shortcut. It may not work with all apps, such as Kindle. The visual benefit alone might be worth it for readers who prefer larger on-screen text as well as the removal of ads and noise from busy websites. If the default text-to-speech engine is not a desired voice, downloads might be available. Reading mode can be downloaded from Google Play.
- Most browsers include a built-in option to declutter website articles via a document icon in the browser search bar.
	- Chrome browser's reading mode may be tucked away in an overflow menu, and it may not be enabled by default. It is easy enough to enable following these [instructions](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-reading-mode-2-3354627/). The instructions should work on Android or iOS.

For a dedicated free mobile reading app with excellent text-to-speech, Reader by ElevenLabs is a powerful app that offers a variety of high quality AI voices to read any document or book that has been downloaded to a device in a compatible format. It is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.elevenlabs.readerapp&hl=en-US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reader-by-elevenlabs/id6479373050).

[Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) is one of the most practical tools since it offers a broad range of AI summarized book titles in text or audio formats, but it comes at a premium.

Financial topics can be dry reading. The right author and style of book can make the big difference between a book you stay interested in versus one that will primarily be used for reference. The more you build your foundational understanding, the easier listening will become without the need for things like charts and tables to visualize concepts for you, which can actually make listening to financial books more difficult for novice investors.
