Some common terms are listed below.
### Above-the-Line Deductions
- Certain adjustments made to reduce taxable income and determine AGI, which are independent of the standard or itemized deduction.
- Wikipedia [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above-the-line_deduction).
### Active vs. Passive Investing
- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-vs-passive-investing/)
### Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
- All sources of income minus adjustments.
- AGI is calculated before taking the standard or itemized deduction.
- AGI is used to determine eligibility to claim deductions and credits, e.g., the annual medical expense deduction is capped based on a percentage of AGI.
### Dollar cost averaging (DCA)
- [Dollar-cost averaging](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging#:~:text=Dollar%20cost%20averaging%20is%20the,as%20well%20as%20your%20costs) involves investing the same amount of money at regular intervals over a certain period of time, regardless of price. It is a simple, emotionally detached form of investing that the average investor can benefit from. It prevents market hype from deterring an investor by consistently putting money to work with long term returns as the goal.
### Earnings growth
- [Earnings growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_growth) is the change in an entity\'s reported net income over a period of time. The measure is usually a period-to-period comparison, such as from quarter to quarter, from year to year, or a comparison of the current quarter\'s results to those of the same quarter last year. The concept can also be used to estimate growth in a future period over the current period. A high level of earnings growth is more likely to drive up the market price of a company\'s stock. Conversely, if the earnings growth rate declines, this can trigger a sell off by investors that drives down the stock price.
### [Expense Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp)
- It is the calculation of a funds total management cost / fund's total assets, but this value is provided to the investor by law. This does not include loads or commissions.

### Equities
- Stocks (shares of ownership) of a company.
### Fiduciary
- Fiduciaries are legally bound to put their client’s best interests ahead of their own. This should be 100% of the time for investors trusting a professional. It can be less than this if a professional is not bound by a code of professional ethics based on their certification.
### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
- Employee sponsored [flexible spending accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flexiblespendingaccount.asp) are generally only an advantage if qualified yearly expenses are known ahead of time, since it is a use it or lose plan. See also [HSA vs FSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/vngamn/hsa_vs_fsa/), and [Whats the benefit of an FSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/197baaw/whats_the_benefit_of_an_fsa/) (r/Bogleheads).
### Fund of Funds
- A fund of funds pools investment capital into multiple funds, such as ETFs or mutual funds, rather than a single fund. It increases diversification beyond a single fund's assortment of stocks and bonds and is often the simplest way to spread investment capital in the market. Target date funds will be allocated between multiple funds.
### Health Savings Account (HSA)
- A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged account for individuals and dependents covered under high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to save for qualified medical expenses. Contributions are made into the account by the individual or their employer and are limited to a maximum amount each year.

### Hedge
- A hedge is an investment that is selected to reduce the potential for loss in other investments because its price tends to move in the opposite direction. The simplest hedge that the average investor should use is investing in assets where the rate of return on investment is greater than the devaluation of capital caused by inflation.
### Liquidity
- [Liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. 
### Load
- A [load](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/load.asp) is a sales charge or commission charged to an investor when buying or redeeming shares in a mutual fund – Investopedia
### Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)
- See the definition of [modified adjusted gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051115/what-difference-between-magi-modified-adjusted-gross-income-and-adjusted-gross-income.asp) from Investopedia. The basics are:
	- "MAGI is your adjusted gross income after taking certain tax deductions and tax-exempt interest into account. It modifies your AGI by adding back items like foreign earned income, student loan interest, and the excluded portion of adoption expenses. For most taxpayers, MAGI is simply AGI, or AGI with the student loan interest deduction added back in. As such, you may consider it as taking away those deductions."
	- MAGI is used to determine things such as if pre-tax IRA contributions are deductible.
	- This [article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/modified-adjusted-gross-income-magi) is also helpful and lists items that may adjust MAGI.
### Ordinary Income
- [Ordinary income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) is any [income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) earned by an organization or an individual and is taxable at [marginal tax rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp). It can include wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, commissions, rents, royalties, [short-term capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp), unqualified dividends, and interest income. – Investopedia
## Tax Definitions
### Effective Tax Rate
- The average tax rate paid on all income to a taxing authority. The number is unique to each individual and is equal to **total tax/taxable income * 100%**. You can find your total tax on line 24 of Form 1040 of your tax return and your taxable income on line 15.
### Marginal Tax Rate
- The [marginal tax rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp) is usually the same as the rate paid on the highest dollar of taxable income (or rather every dollar of AGI that falls into this tax bracket) in a graduated/progressive tax system, such as the IRS uses to tax earned income and capital gains.
### Pre-tax
- Referring to income or an investment account that has not been taxed yet (tax-deferred), e.g., investment accounts: traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs.
### Post-tax
- Referring to income or an investment account that has already been taxed. This money can be invested into tax-free-withdrawal accounts (when withdrawn after the retirement age is reached) such as Roth IRAs, or HSAs, or taxable brokerage accounts (subject to short or long term capital gains tax).
### [Tax Drag](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-drag.asp)
- The loss of income due to capital gains tax triggered by a taxable event, such as the sale of an asset.
### [Tax Advantaged](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-advantaged.asp)
- A financial investment that gives the investor a tax benefit. Most commonly this will refer to an investment account that allows the investor to decide when their money will be taxed, e.g., IRAs, or is tax free depending on how the money is used, e.g., a health savings account, or is a combination, e.g., again a health savings account allows withdrawals for qualified medical expenses to be used tax free and also allows investment money to grow tax free until a certain age, when it can be withdrawn and taxed as ordinary income similar to a traditional IRA.
	- After making the decision to invest for the future, understanding how to prevent as much of an investment from being taxed and or spent on management fees comes second in importance.
### Tax Cost Ratio
- [Tax cost ratio](https://community.morningstar.com/s/article/What-is-Tax-Cost-Ratio-and-for-how-many-years-is-it-calculated-on-Morningstar-com-USA) is a measurement of how much of a fund's annualized return is reduced by taxes investors pay on distributions.
### Tax Efficient
- Tax efficient is a term used to describe investments that do not trigger taxable events, or do not trigger them very often, and come with the lowest possible tax bill when taxable events do occur. Investment into a fund that does not buy and sell the securities contained within it as often as another fund would be the tax efficient choice between the two funds, because selling securities for capital gain triggers a taxable event with capital gains tax being owed. ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds due to their in-kind redemption. Likewise, selling investments after the long term capital gains tax holding period is more tax efficient than selling them sooner and incurring short term capital gains tax. The term tax efficient account simply means a taxable account that an investor has filled with tax efficient investments. 
### Tax-Loss Harvesting
- Tax-loss harvesting is the selling of securities at a loss to offset the amount of capital gains tax owed from selling profitable assets or lower ordinary income for a given tax year. For investors with more capital loss than is allowed for deduction in the current year, carryover is indefinite and deductions are always above-the-line.
- Although somewhat counterintuitive, selling for a loss and repurchasing at the same (or about the same price) and subsequently investing tax savings *results in more investment income* and a higher investment return later on.
- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp) provides a thorough explanation and breakdown of use cases.
### Wash Sale
- A wash sale is a transaction in which an investor sells or trades a security at a loss and purchases “a substantially similar one” 30 days before or 30 days after the sale. The IRS enacted the wash sale rule which prevents investors from selling a security for a capital loss just to take advantage of the deduction for tax filing and immediately repurchase it. The pre-purchase/repurchase of a substantially similar security must occur outside of this 60-day window for the loss to be claimed.
## Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
- See a linked [definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp) since the rules may change.
	- The calculation is: **(IRA balance at the end of the previous year) / (RMD factor)**
		- The RMD factor is found in a [table](https://smartasset.com/retirement/rmd-table) and is based on a retirees age at the end of the previous year. A [calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/calculate-rmd) is also available and also linked in Resources.
	- There is a large fiscal penalty for not withdrawing a RMD.
	- It is important to understand that compounded growth of a high value account will 
	- RMDs do not apply to Roth accounts.
## Security
- A tradeable financial asset: equities (stocks), debt (bonds), derivatives, etc.
