Terms that investors should become familiar with.
### Above-the-line deductions
- Tax filing income adjustments that are independent of the standard or itemized deduction.
- Wikipedia [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above-the-line_deduction).
### Active vs. passive Investing
- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-vs-passive-investing/)
### Adjusted gross income (AGI)
- All sources of income minus adjustments.
- AGI is calculated before taking the standard or itemized deduction.
- AGI is used to determine eligibility to claim deductions and credits, e.g., the annual medical expense deduction is capped based on a percentage of AGI.
- See also [Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)](#Modified-Adjusted-Gross-Income-(MAGI))<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->
### Custodian
- A custodian is a financial institution, entity, or person responsible for safeguarding and managing assets on behalf of an account holder.
- Typically referring to a bank, brokerage firm, fund manager, or parent.
### Dividend
- A payment made by a company to its shareholders as a distribution of its profits. 
### Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)
- [Dollar-cost averaging](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging#:~:text=Dollar-cost-averaging-is-the,as-well-as-your-costs) involves investing the same amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of price. It is a simple form of investing that the average investor can benefit from. The strategy prevents market hype from deterring an investor and results in consistently putting money to work with a long-term outlook.
### Earnings growth
- [Earnings growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_growth) is the change in an company's reported net income over a period of time. The measure is usually a period-to-period comparison, such as from quarter to quarter, from year to year, or a comparison of the current quarter's results to those of the same quarter last year. The concept can also be used to estimate growth in a future period over the current period. A high level of earnings growth is more likely to drive up the market price of a company's stock. Conversely, if the earnings growth rate declines, this can trigger a sell off by investors that drives down the stock price.
### Expense ratio
- The calculation of a fund's total management cost / total fund assets. The [expense ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp) is the minimal cost of owning a fund, and by law is provided in the prospectus for all investment funds. It does not include loads, sales commissions, transaction fees, etc. A cost efficient portfolio can be designed to have no fees other than expense ratios. 
### Equity
- Ownership of a company; stock.
### Fiduciary
- Fiduciaries are legally bound to put their client’s best interests ahead of their own. Clients would hope this is 100% of the time from any financial advisor. However, it can be less than this if a professional is not bound by a code of ethics or because of how they are acting on behalf of their client. A client should always confirm the professional relationship they have with an advisor, including a fiduciary, to confirm that the services offered requires the advisor to act as a fiduciary.

### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
- Employee sponsored [flexible spending accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flexiblespendingaccount.asp) are generally only an advantage if qualified yearly expenses are known ahead of time, since funds must be used by the end of the year or forfeited back to the employer. See also [HSA vs FSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/vngamn/hsa_vs_fsa/), and [Whats the benefit of an FSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/197baaw/whats_the_benefit_of_an_fsa/) (r/Bogleheads).
### Fund of funds
- A fund that pools investment capital into multiple funds rather than a single fund. It increases diversification beyond a single fund's assortment of stocks and bonds and is often the simplest way to spread investment capital in the market. Target date funds will be allocated between multiple funds.
### Health Savings Account (HSA)
- A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged account for individuals and dependents covered under high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to save for qualified medical expenses. Contributions are made into the account by the individual or their employer and are limited to a maximum amount each year.
- See also [Health Savings Account (HSA)](accounts/types.md#health-savings-account-hsa)<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->
### Hedge
- A hedge is an investment that is selected to reduce the potential for loss in other investments because its price tends to move in the opposite direction. A simple example of hedging is investing in assets whose rate of return is greater than the devaluation of simply saving caused by inflation.
### Instrument
- A financial instrument is a contract or document that represents a financial asset to one party and a financial liability or equity to another party. Financial instruments include debt (e.g., mortgages, fixed income securities, CDs, and savings accounts), equity (e.g., stock), foreign currency exchange, and derivatives (e.g., options, futures, and forwards). A financial instrument is one of the many financial products investors can choose from.
### Liquidity
- [Liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. 
### Load
- A [load](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/load.asp) is a sales charge or commission charged to an investor when buying or redeeming shares in a mutual fund. – Investopedia
### Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)
- MAGI is your adjusted gross income after taking certain tax deductions and tax-exempt interest into account. It modifies your AGI by adding back items like foreign earned income, student loan interest, and the excluded portion of adoption expenses. For most taxpayers, MAGI is simply AGI, or AGI with the student loan interest deduction added back in. As such, you may consider it as taking away those deductions. – Investopedia
- MAGI is used to determine things such as if pre-tax IRA contributions are deductible.
- For the full definition of [modified adjusted gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051115/what-difference-between-magi-modified-adjusted-gross-income-and-adjusted-gross-income.asp), see Investopedia.
- This [article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/modified-adjusted-gross-income-magi) lists items that may adjust MAGI.
### Ordinary income
- [Ordinary income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp) is any [income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp) earned by an organization or an individual and is taxable at [marginal tax rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp). It can include wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, commissions, rents, royalties, [short-term capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp), unqualified dividends, and interest income. – Investopedia
## Tax Definitions
### Cost basis
- The original value or purchase price of an asset. This figure is used to calculate the capital gain or loss when an asset is sold.
### Effective tax rate
- The average tax rate paid on all income to a taxing authority. The number is unique to each individual and is equal to **total tax / taxable income * 100%**. U.S. investors will find their total tax on line 24 of Form 1040 of their tax return and taxable income on line 15.
### Marginal tax rate
- The [marginal tax rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp) is usually the same as the rate paid on the highest dollar of taxable income (or rather every dollar of AGI that falls into this tax bracket) in a graduated/progressive tax system, such as the IRS uses to tax earned income and capital gains.
### Pre-tax
- Referring to income or an investment account that has not been taxed yet (tax-deferred), e.g., investment accounts: traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs.
### Post-tax
- Referring to income or an investment account that has already been taxed. After tax income can be invested into accounts that offer tax-free withdrawal for qualified purposes, i.e. Roth accounts, or taxable brokerage accounts, which are subject to capital gains tax.
### [Tax advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-advantaged.asp)
- Any legal method that gives a tax benefit to an investor. Commonly, this refers to an investment account, investment product, or feature of a product.
- Examples of account advantages:
	- Accounts that let the investor decide when their money will be taxed, e.g., tax deferral via IRAs.
	- Qualified tax-free use of funds, e.g., a 529 plan or health savings account.
	- A combination, e.g., a health savings account allows for tax deductible contributions, tax-deferred investment growth, tax-free withdrawal for qualified health expenses, and tax-deferred withdrawals for non-qualified expenses.
- Other advantages include long-term capital gain tax, tax-free fixed income securities, and step-up in basis inheritance rules. 
### Tax-cost ratio
- [Tax cost ratio](https://community.morningstar.com/s/article/What-is-Tax-Cost-Ratio-and-for-how-many-years-is-it-calculated-on-Morningstar-com-USA) is a measurement of how much of a fund's annualized return is reduced by taxes investors pay on distributions. The figure is calculated per a investment period, e.g., a fund with a 3-year tax cost ratio of 1% means the fund would lose 1% of its annual returns to pay for taxes. This number is important, because it should be considered in addition to expense ratio to determine the most tax-efficient funds for taxable accounts. The longest period is the most relevant measure of the true cost to long-term investors.
### Tax deferral
Use of an investment vehicle to postpone taxation of the gain on investment. Earnings grow tax free while in vehicle. Taxes are paid upon redemption, e.g., bonds, or withdrawal from a tax-deferred account. This can be to the advantage of an investor if they think they will be in a lower tax bracket in the future.
### [Tax drag](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-drag.asp)
- The loss of income due to capital gains tax triggered by a taxable event, such as the sale of an asset.
### Tax efficient
- Tax efficient is a term used to describe investments that do not trigger mandatory taxable events, or do not trigger them very often, and come with the lowest possible tax bill when taxable events do occur. For example, purchasing a fund in a taxable brokerage account that does not buy and sell the securities in it as often as another fund does would be considered the tax efficient choice between the two. This is due to the capital gain tax owed whenever a security is sold for profit. ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds due to their in-kind redemption. Likewise, selling an investment after the long-term capital gain tax holding period is more tax efficient than selling it sooner and incurring short-term capital gain tax. The term tax efficient account simply means a taxable account that an investor has filled with tax efficient investments. 
### Tax free
A feature of an investment vehicle that gives the following tax benefits to an investor:
- Tax-free interest, e.g., municipal bond interest, U.S. Series EE or Series I bonds used for qualified education expenses.
- Tax-free capital gains, e.g., tax-deferred accounts, Roth accounts, ETFs prior to sale, taking advantage of the 0% percent long-term capital gain tax bracket, or a step-up in basis at inheritance.
- Tax-free withdrawals, e.g., 529 College Savings Plans, Roth accounts, HSAs.
### Tax harvesting
- Tax harvesting can be performed a few different ways, but falls into either of two categorized: tax-gain harvesting or tax-loss harvesting.
	- Taking advantage of lower income years when the sale of securities for a gain will result in the lowest possible capital gain tax and reinvesting in the same asset to increase the cost basis (tax-gain harvesting), or
	- Selling securities at a loss to take advantage of the tax deduction and reinvesting the extra income (tax-loss harvesting), or
	- Selling securities at a loss to offset capital gains or lower AGI (tax-loss harvesting).
- Although somewhat counterintuitive, selling for a loss and repurchasing at the same price (or about the same price) and subsequently investing the resulting tax savings results in greater earnings. Note that the cost basis of securities repurchased at the lower price will be lower, increasing the amount subject to a potential capital gain.
- Losses can always be used to offset gains. Capital losses exceeding gains can be deducted from ordinary income up to a certain amount each year. For investors with more capital loss than is allowed for deduction in a single year, carryover is allowed indefinitely. Deductions are always above-the-line.
- Investors should be aware of the wash sale rule when performing tax-loss harvesting.
- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp) provides a more thorough explanation and breakdown of use cases.
### Tax shelter
- Referring to any legal method used to reduce taxable income. This may include any type of investment vehicle or depreciable (physical) asset.
### Wash sale
- A wash sale is a transaction in which an investor sells or trades a security at a loss and purchases “a substantially similar one” 30 days before or 30 days after the sale. The IRS enacted the wash sale rule to prevent investors from selling a security for a capital loss only to take advantage of the deduction for tax filing, and then immediately repurchase it. The pre-purchase/repurchase of a substantially similar security must occur outside of this 60-day window for the loss to be claimed. For clarification on substantially similar investments see [the Bogleheads' page on wash sales](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale).
## Required minimum distributions (RMDs)
- See a linked [definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp) since the rules may change.
	- The calculation is: **IRA balance at the end of the previous year / RMD factor**
		- The RMD factor is found in a [table](https://smartasset.com/retirement/rmd-table) and is based on a retirees age at the end of the previous year. A [calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/calculate-rmd) is also available and also linked in Resources.
	- There is a large fiscal penalty for not withdrawing an RMD.
	- Since traditional retirement account withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, it is important for investors to understand that compounded growth of a high value account may result in a large tax bill once the RMD age is reached.
	- RMDs do not apply to Roth or HSA accounts.
## Security
- A financial instrument specifically created to be traded on the secondary market—where securities are bought and sold after their initial offering to the public. Examples are equities (stocks), debt (e.g., bonds), derivatives (e.g., options), etc. 
## Turnover
- The amount of buying and selling of assets in fund. 100% [turnover](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021616/what-good-turnover-ratio-mutual-fund.asp) is equal to each stock in a fund being sold and replaced once a year. A fund's turnover statistic can be found in its prospectus.
## Vehicle
- An investment vehicle is an all inclusive term that includes financial instruments, products, or accounts used by investors to help them reach their intended monetary goals.
## Yield
- The income return on an investment, expressed as a percentage of the investment's cost or its current market value. For example, a bond yield is equal to the coupon payment / face value. A stock dividend yield is equal to the dividend payment / share price.
