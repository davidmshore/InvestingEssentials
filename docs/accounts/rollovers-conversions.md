- Transferring investment funds from one retirement account to another is called a [rollover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollover.asp), or a conversion when moving from a traditional to a Roth account.
- There are [various IRS rules](https://www.irs.gov/site-index-search?search=rollover&field_pup_historical_1=1&field_pup_historical=1) regarding rollovers that are posted on their website. This [chart](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf) shows the allowed rollovers and a [summary of the rules](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-rollover-401k-roth-traditional-ira) is provided by NerdWallet.
- The [5-year rule](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/roth-ira-5-year-rule) applies to funds converted to Roth accounts and is the reason behind the [Roth conversion ladder](https://www.investopedia.com/how-roth-conversion-ladder-works-5214808).
	- The [Pro Rata rule](https://smartasset.com/retirement/a-guide-to-the-pro-rata-rule-and-roth-iras) applies to conversions from pre-tax to Roth accounts if an investor has made after-tax contributions to *any* of their pre-tax retirement accounts. This will only apply to high earners/low spenders contributing to traditional retirement accounts beyond the pre-tax limits. The rule effectively taxes a percentage of the conversion equivalent to:
		- (Aggregate non-deductible contributions) / (Aggregate non-Roth IRA balances)
		- Keep record of the amount of non-deductible contributions that have been converted, because this affects the numerator for future conversions.
	- Before age 59-1/2, distributions from an IRA are non-qualified and subject to penalty. To avoid the possibility of a conversion being reported to the IRS as a distribution *do not* withhold tax. Instead, pay the tax when filing with money from outside retirement accounts, and report the amount converted on form 8606 then.
	- Expect a 1099-R from the investment firm that performed the conversion.
