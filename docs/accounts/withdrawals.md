| **What is SEPP?**                | SEPP is an IRS exception that allows individuals to take early withdrawals from tax-advantaged retirement accounts (such as IRAs or 401(k)s) without the **10% early withdrawal penalty**. This can be useful for early retirees or anyone needing to access retirement savings before age 59½.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Age Requirement**              | Available to individuals under **age 59½**. Normally, early withdrawals from retirement accounts are subject to a **10% penalty**, but SEPP allows for penalty-free withdrawals if the rules are followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Withdrawal Period**            | Withdrawals must be taken over a period of at least **5 years** or until the individual reaches **59½**, whichever is longer. For example: <br> - If you are 50 years old, you must take SEPPs until you are **55** (5 years), even though you would normally face penalties until age 59½. <br> - If you are 58 years old, you must continue withdrawals until **63** (5 years).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Approved Calculation Methods** | There are **3 approved methods** for calculating the SEPP amount: <br> 1. **Fixed Amortization Method**: Calculates payments by amortizing the account balance over your life expectancy using a reasonable interest rate (no more than 120% of the IRS Federal Mid-Term rate). <br> 2. **Fixed Annuitization Method**: Similar to fixed amortization, but uses an **annuity factor** derived from IRS tables based on life expectancy and an interest rate. <br> 3. **RMD Method**: Divides your account balance by your **life expectancy** (based on IRS tables) each year. This method usually results in smaller withdrawals in the earlier years of the plan. |
| **Consistency Requirement**      | Once you choose a calculation method, you **must stick with it** for the **duration of the SEPP plan** (either 5 years or until you reach 59½, whichever is longer). You cannot change the method or withdrawal amount during the plan period, except under specific circumstances like: <br> - Death <br> - Disability <br> - Some account-related changes (e.g., rollovers between similar accounts).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Penalty for Changing Plan**    | If you alter the **payment amount** or change the **calculation method** before completing the required time (5 years or 59½), the IRS will apply the **10% early withdrawal penalty retroactively** to all of the withdrawals you took under the SEPP plan. For example, if you started SEPP at age 50, but changed the withdrawal amount at age 52, you would be subject to penalties on the previous withdrawals from ages 50-52.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Minimum Duration**             | SEPP withdrawals must continue for at least **5 years** or until the account holder reaches **59½**, whichever is longer. <br> - Example 1: Start SEPP at age 50 → Withdrawals must continue until age 55. <br> - Example 2: Start SEPP at age 58 → Withdrawals must continue until age 63.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Early Withdrawal Penalty**     | **No 10% penalty** applies if you follow SEPP rules. However, if you modify the plan or don’t follow the rules properly, the 10% penalty will apply retroactively on all withdrawals made under the SEPP program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Purpose**                      | SEPP provides a way to access retirement funds early (before age 59½) without the 10% early withdrawal penalty. This can be useful for: <br> - **Early retirees** who need income before 59½. <br> - People who need funds in an emergency but don’t want to pay the penalty. <br> - Those who want to start withdrawing funds from tax-advantaged accounts and avoid penalties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Calculation Factors**          | SEPP calculations depend on: <br> 1. **Account balance** at the time of the first distribution. <br> 2. **Life expectancy**: IRS tables are used to calculate life expectancy. <br> 3. **Interest rate**: The IRS allows a specific maximum interest rate (up to 120% of the IRS Federal Mid-Term Rate) to be used when calculating SEPP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Exceptions to Changing SEPP**  | There are a few exceptions when you **can** modify the SEPP plan without incurring retroactive penalties, such as: <br> - Death <br> - Disability (qualifying disability as per IRS rules) <br> - If you roll over funds from one similar plan to another (e.g., from an IRA to a new IRA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
