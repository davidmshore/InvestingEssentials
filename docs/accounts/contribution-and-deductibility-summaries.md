Create a markdown table with the following columns: "Account Type or Conversion," "Contribution Limit (Year based on knowledge cutoff date)," and "Summary of Rules."
1. The Contribution Limit column should include the contribution limits for the year based on the knowledge cutoff date and the contribution cutoff dates. Include after tax contribution limits. If there is no contribution limit, state "No contribution limit."
2. The Summary of Rules column should detail how contributions to the account affect contributions to other account types, and income eligibility when applicable. If no other account types are affected, do not mention them.
3. For Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and Backdoor Roth IRA, clearly state that the contribution limit is combined with the other IRA type (Traditional or Roth).
4. Ensure all deadlines and income eligibility rules are clearly stated on separate lines within their respective columns.
