2. The Summary of Rules column should detail how contributions to the account affect contributions to other account types, and income eligibility when applicable. If no other account types are affected, do not mention them.
3. For Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and Backdoor Roth IRA, clearly state that the contribution limit is combined with the other IRA type (Traditional or Roth).
