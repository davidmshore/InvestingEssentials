## Pre-Tax, Post-Tax, and Taxable Accounts
- Individual **brokerage accounts**, not a 401k, an IRA, or any other retirement account, are subject to capital gains tax when equities (stocks) or debt investments (bonds) are sold, as well as tax on dividends and earned interest. Capital is just another term for money that is invested, and the earnings on that investment are called capital gains. Capital losses are the opposite and want to avoided. However, losses can still be useful when used as deductions to reduce taxable income. Capital gains and losses will be covered in more detail later on, but the important concept with taxable accounts is that anytime a sale of an asset is made, this triggers a taxable event for the tax year it takes place in.
	- Brokerage accounts are always funded with after tax dollars.
	- Brokerage accounts may be held jointly by two or more people.
- The government offers tax advantages for funding a retirement account to encourage people to save for retirement.
	- Retirement accounts may only be held by an individual.
- Although retirement accounts may be opened through a brokerage firm, **the term brokerage account is synonymous with taxable account**, whereas a **retirement account refers to a tax advantaged account**.
	- This will become more clear as you read on, and here is a discussion on the differences asked by a Redditor that can be referred back to if there is still any confusion, [any different between a individual brokerage account vs a traditional IRA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1f01m26/any_different_between_a_individual_brokerage/) (r/investing).
- Retirement accounts and special investment accounts, such as HSAs, are called tax advantaged accounts. The advantage is that any monetary investment growth—dividends, earned interest, and capital gains—is not taxed while the money is in the account.
	- Investment capital into these types of accounts is contributed either pre-tax (as with traditional IRAs, 401ks, and HSAs) and is taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn during retirement, or it is contributed post-tax (as with Roth accounts) meaning it is invested after is has been taxed at ordinary income tax rates and can be withdrawn tax free.
	- Investment securities in either pre or post-tax accounts may be bought and sold freely within the account without being subject to capital gains tax. This means that reallocation of investments from a more aggressive strategy while an investor is younger to a more conservative strategy as an investor ages occurs tax free.
	- The money is taxed either when going into the account or coming out of the account as ordinary income. 
- Pre-tax retirement accounts are generally more advantageous for people who are currently in a higher tax bracket.
	- The idea is that the individual will be in a lower tax bracket when they retire, and withdrawals of the tax deferred earnings will be subject to lower taxes based on ordinary income tax brackets. Remember too, that filing jointly doubles the amount of income per tax bracket.
	- By law, pre-tax accounts require the account holder to begin withdrawing a certain percentage of the account value upon reaching a certain age. These withdrawals are called required minimum distributions (RMDs), which affect tax planning, because this money will be taxed as ordinary income and these withdrawals can become large.
	- **Contributions to pre-tax accounts are tax deductible as *above-the-line* deductions, meaning that they are deducted before the standard deduction and therefore always deductible based on income during the tax year. Rules for how much of a contribution can be deducted are covered in the table below. It is up to the investor to take advantage of tax-deductible contributions to pre-tax accounts by reporting them on their tax returns.**
	- **Pre-tax contributions are only tax deductible for the current tax year.**
	- **Withdrawals from pre-tax accounts are taxed as ordinary income and can therefore always take advantage of the standard deduction.**
- Post-tax retirement accounts may be advantageous for people contributing income to a retirement account who are currently in a low tax bracket, because contributions are taxed at current income tax rates and the money may be withdrawn tax free after a certain age. 
	- Since Roth withdrawals have already been taxed, these withdrawals do not count as income during retirement when calculating AGI which determines the marginal tax bracket. This is a consideration for which account types to use if an investor will also have investment income from taxable brokerage accounts during retirement.
- Many investors opt for a variety of tax-advantaged and tax efficient brokerage accounts to help lessen the tax bill when it comes to retirement by making it easier to control adjusted gross income, required minimum distributions, and so forth.
	- For example, investments in taxable brokerage accounts, which are taxed at capital gains tax rates rather than ordinary income, allow an investor to take advantage of **zero taxes on the first ~$50K dollars in capital gains** ($48,350 for 2025 single tax filers and double that for joint filers). This number will continue to go up in the future to keep up with inflation. This number is doubled for married couples who file taxes jointly. The option to use multiple accounts will partially depend the availability of investment capital during the working years. However, if there is any expectation of inheritance, it can benefit investors to be prepared with options for handling large tax events.
		- The following strategy  shows the importance of understanding how to use pre-tax, post-tax, and taxable brokerage accounts together for investors who have enough income during their working years to fund each account and plan on having enough earnings in their taxable brokerage accounts from long term capital gains and/or qualified dividends to live off of during the early years of retirement.
		- The strategy is to fund pre-tax retirement accounts during the working years and **convert withdrawals to Roth accounts early on during retirement, but only convert as much as can be cancelled out by the standard deduction**, because whether money is withdrawn from a 401k/traditional IRA for spending or converted to a Roth IRA, it will be added to AGI and taxed as ordinary income. Using this conversion strategy, the **money goes into investment tax free, grows tax free, and is withdrawn tax free**. Moreover, Roth IRAs do not have required minimum distributions.
		- See how it pays off to live below ones means during the investment years to be able to take advantage of multiple investment accounts? This may be too much to understand at the moment, but when you start to understand the tax laws it will make more sense. This strategy is covered in more detail in an article from [GoCurryCracker](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/never-pay-taxes-again/).
- The income tax in the state that you plan to retire in can also be a factor when deciding which accounts to withdraw money from during retirement.
- State law can also be a factor when it comes to deducting the contributions to a retirement account during working years.
- Transferring investment funds between pre-tax account types does not trigger a tax penalty, e.g., from a 401(k) to a traditional IRA, but if the transfer is to take place between accounts held at different financial institutions and a cash payout is sent to the investor, the money must be deposited into the other account, and the transfer completed, within the allowed timeframe to avoid paying income tax. This is called a [rollover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollover.asp).
- This section was a brief introduction to the importance of tax planning when setting up a retirement plan that maximizes an investor's returns.
- A number of concepts have been mentioned so far, and the options that come with these topics are only going to increase. This may cause new investors to start feeling overwhelmed with what is called analysis paralysis, which is based in FOMO. Just remember that options exist, because people are in different situations in life. Some people have access to more of them than others, and not all of them will apply to each investor. Stay focused on building on what has already been mentioned and learning how to maximize an overall investment strategy through avoiding the major expenses and tax pitfalls that the overly lazy investor can get caught by.
