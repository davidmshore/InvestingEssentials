## Taxable Brokerage Accounts
- Individual **brokerage accounts** are subject to capital gains tax when equities (stocks) or debt investments (bonds) are sold, as well as tax on dividends and earned interest. Capital is just another term for money that is invested, and the earnings on that investment are called capital gains. Capital losses are the opposite and generally want to be avoided. However, losses can be useful when used as deductions to reduce taxable income. Capital gains and losses will be covered in more detail later on, but the important concept with brokerage accounts is that anytime an investor sells an asset, or gets paid a dividend or interest, this triggers a taxable event for the tax year it occurs in.
	- Brokerage accounts are always funded with after tax dollars.
	- Brokerage accounts may be held jointly by two or more people.
## Retirement Accounts
- The government offers tax advantages for funding a retirement account to encourage people to prepare for retirement.
	- Retirement accounts may only be held by an individual.
	- Rules for married couples who file joint taxes allow an earning spouse to contribute to the non-earning or low earning spouse's individual retirement account (IRA). 
- Although retirement accounts may be opened through a brokerage firm, **the term brokerage account is synonymous with taxable account**, whereas a **retirement account refers to a tax advantaged account**, e.g., a 401(k) or an IRA.
	- This will become more clear as you read on, and if you still have questions, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1f01m26/any_different_between_a_individual_brokerage/) are some detailed answers given to a novice investor on account differences.
- Retirement accounts and special investment accounts, such as HSAs, are called tax advantaged accounts, because any monetary investment growth—dividends, earned interest, and capital gains—is not taxed while the money is in the account.
	- Investment capital into these types of accounts is contributed either pre-tax (as with traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and HSAs) and is taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn, or it is contributed post-tax (as with Roth accounts) meaning it is invested after is has been taxed at ordinary income tax rates and can be withdrawn tax free.
	- Investment securities in either pre or post-tax accounts may be bought and sold freely within the account without being subject to capital gains tax. This means that reallocation of investments from a more aggressive strategy while an investor is younger to a more conservative strategy as an investor ages occurs tax free.
	- The money is taxed either when going into the account or coming out of the account as ordinary income. 
	- Funds may be withdrawn freely after age 59-1/2 as qualified distributions. Withdrawals prior to this age will result in a penalty unless [exceptions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/02/111202.asp) are met or [special rules](early-withdrawals.md)<!-- #internal_link link --> are followed.
### Pre-Tax
- Pre-tax retirement accounts are generally more advantageous for people who are currently in a higher tax bracket.
	- The idea is that the individual will be in a lower tax bracket when they retire, and withdrawals of the tax deferred earnings will be subject to lower taxes based on ordinary income tax brackets. Remember too, that filing jointly doubles the amount of income per tax bracket. Depending on how withdrawals are spent, they may be eligible for state income tax deductions or tax free qualified charitable donations.
	- By law, pre-tax retirement accounts require the account holder to begin withdrawing a certain percentage of the account value annually by April 1st upon reaching a certain age to avoid penalty. This age is slowly going up and is soon to be 75. These withdrawals are called required minimum distributions (RMDs), which affect tax planning, because this money will be taxed as ordinary income and these withdrawals can become large. A [calculator](../resources/tools.md#required-minimum-distributions-rmds)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> is included in Resources.
		- Workplace retirement plans for a current employer are an exception if the accountholder continues working past the RMD age (and the employee is not a 5% shareholder of the company). This exception may include part time workers depending on employment rules.
		- If an investor has multiple 401(k) workplace retirement accounts, RMDs are required on each account, whereas multiple IRAs or multiple 403(b)s can be aggregated to meet RMDs. However, the two different account types cannot be aggregated. This is where rollovers will become important, which are covered later. 
	- **Contributions to pre-tax accounts are tax deductible as *above-the-line* deductions, meaning that they are deducted before the standard deduction, depending on income, for the tax year. It is up to the investor to take advantage of tax-deductible contributions to pre-tax accounts by reporting them on their tax returns.**
	- **Pre-tax contributions are only tax deductible for the current tax year.**
	- **Withdrawals from pre-tax accounts are taxed as ordinary income and can always take advantage of the standard deduction.**
### Post-Tax
- Post-tax retirement accounts may be advantageous for people contributing income to a retirement account who are currently in a low tax bracket, because contributions are taxed at current income tax rates and the money may be withdrawn tax free after a certain age. 
	- Since Roth withdrawals have already been taxed, these withdrawals do not count as income during retirement and do not affect adjusted gross income (AGI), which is what determines the marginal tax rate and the capital gains tax rate. This is a consideration for which account types to use if an investor will also have income from taxable brokerage accounts along with social security during retirement.
	- Roth accounts are subject to the [5-year rule](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/retirement/roth-ira-5-year-rule) which requires the account to be open for 5 years from January 1st of the contribution year before earnings can be accessed without tax or penalty.
	- Roth contributions are always accessible without tax or penalty.
	- Roth accounts do not have RMDs, so the investor is free to choose how much to withdraw each year.
## Making the Most of Tax Advantages
- MadFientist provides a simplified [scenario](https://www.madfientist.com/retire-even-earlier/) of how these accounts can benefit investors, especially those with plans for early retirement.
- Many investors opt for a combination of tax-advantaged and tax efficient brokerage accounts to help lessen the tax bill both before and during retirement. Multiple accounts are especially useful for early retirees by making it easier to control AGI later on when receiving social security benefits.
	- For example, investments sold after holding for more than a year in taxable brokerage accounts, which are taxed at long term capital gains tax rates rather than ordinary income, allow an investor to take advantage of **zero tax on the first ~$50K dollars in capital gains** ($48,350 for 2025 single tax filers and double that for joint filers). This number will continue to go up in the future to keep up with inflation and is twice the amount for married couples who file taxes jointly. The option to fund multiple accounts during the working years is open to anyone, but how much will depend on earned income, the availability of investment capital and contribution limits.
		- The following strategy shows the importance of understanding how to use pre-tax, post-tax, and taxable brokerage accounts together. It relies on having enough income from a taxable brokerage account to live off of during the early years of retirement, either from dividend earnings or selling investments.
		- The strategy is to fund pre-tax retirement accounts during the working years and **convert withdrawals to Roth accounts early on during retirement, but only convert as much as can be cancelled out by the standard deduction (or however much the investor is willing to pay in lower taxes during the early years of retirement)**. Whether money is withdrawn from a 401k/traditional IRA for spending or converted to a Roth IRA, it will be added to AGI and taxed as ordinary income. Using this conversion strategy, the **money goes into investment tax free, grows tax free, and is withdrawn tax free** (per the 5-year rule). Consider too that eligibility for programs such as Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans are based on modified adjusted gross income MAGI<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->.
		- See how it pays off to live below one's means during the investment years to be able to take advantage of multiple investment accounts? This may be too much to fully figure out your own plan at the moment, but when you start to understand the tax laws it will make more sense. This strategy is covered in more detail in an article from [GoCurryCracker](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/never-pay-taxes-again/).
		- While this tax strategy becomes especially important for high net worth investors whose traditional retirement account growth will outpace even their RMDs during retirement, it helps anyone in low tax brackets by converting taxable money to tax free, withdrawal free investments.
## Other Considerations
- State law is a factor when it comes to retirement account contributions during working years.
- State income tax can also be a factor when deciding which accounts to withdraw money from during retirement.
- Transferring investment funds between pre-tax retirement accounts does not trigger a tax penalty, e.g., from a 401(k) to a traditional IRA, but if the transfer is to take place between accounts held at different financial institutions and a cash payout is sent to the investor, the money must be deposited into the other account, and the transfer completed, within the allowed timeframe to avoid paying income tax. This is called a [rollover](rollovers-conversions.md)<!-- #internal_link -->.
- When opening an IRA, the accountholder has the option to name one or more beneficiaries. This beneficiary supersedes instructions given in a will, and ensures that retirement accounts avoid probate. For a married accountholder, a surviving spouse is the assumed beneficiary if no one is named. A beneficiary other than a spouse requires the spouse to waive their right to the inheritance. For an unmarried accountholder, if a beneficiary is not named then the retirement account must go through probate. Additionally, a *per stirpes* designation on a beneficiary ensures that a beneficiary's descendants receive the inheritance if the primary beneficiary is deceased when the inheritance is passed on.
## Moving Forward
- This section was a brief introduction to the importance of tax planning when setting up a retirement plan that maximizes an investor's returns.
- A number of concepts have been mentioned so far, and the options that come with these topics are only going to increase. This may cause new investors to start feeling overwhelmed with what is called analysis paralysis, which is based in FOMO. Just remember that options exist, because people are in different situations in life. Some people have access to more of them than others, and rarely will all of them will apply to a single investor. Stay focused on building on what has already been covered and learning how to maximize an overall investment strategy by avoiding the major expenses and tax pitfalls that the overly lazy investor can get caught by. Refer back to the [Prime Directive flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpeg) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) to put things into perspective.
