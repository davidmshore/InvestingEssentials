#### Health Savings Account (HSA)
- [HSAs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) are similar to traditional IRAs in terms of their tax advantage with a few additional perks. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax free and may be drawn at any age. Otherwise, withdrawals used for non-medical expenses are taxed as ordinary income and subject to a penalty fee calculated as a percentage of the withdrawn amount. However, after age 65 there is no penalty for withdrawals for non-medical expenses, and these withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, just like a traditional IRA. Another difference from a traditional IRA, is that **required minimum distributions do not apply to HSAs**.
- Younger, healthy individuals can take advantage of generally lower medical expenses and the **triple tax advantage of tax free contributions, growth and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses**.
- Reimbursement rules for qualified medical expenses allow for the account holder to pay for medical expenses out of pocket and reimburse themselves at any point in the future, e.g., after the account has had time to compound and increase in value. Keep medical bills for future reimbursement. **Reimbursements are only allowed for medical expenses incurred after opening the HSA**.
- There are caveats to opening and contributing to an HSA, like having a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). These plans have higher annual deductibles (minimum four figure dollar amounts for singles). The trade-off is that the monthly premiums for young people is often relatively cheap, so the extra money that would normally go toward paying higher premiums can be invested into an HSA to compound for future expenses. The account value of an HSA at any point in time will depend on the assets the investor chooses to purchase, similar to a retirement or brokerage account.

>Qualified medical expenses are those expenses that would generally qualify for the medical and dental expenses deduction. These are explained in [Pub. 502, Medical and Dental Expenses](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-502).

| **Eligibility**                   | - You must be enrolled in a **High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)** to contribute to an HSA.<br>- HDHPs are defined by the IRS, with minimum deductible and out-of-pocket maximums that change annually.<br>- Cannot be enrolled in Medicare or have other health coverage (e.g., general health insurance, coverage under a spouse's plan) that is not HDHP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Account Ownership**             | - **You own the account**: The funds are yours, even if you change jobs or health plans. This is unlike Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), which are typically employer-owned. <br>- **No "use-it-or-lose-it" rule**: Unused funds carry over year after year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Account Usage**                 | - **Married Family**: If both spouses are covered under the same HDHP, they can use the HSA funds for any qualified medical expenses for themselves, their children, and any dependents claimed on their tax return. <br>- **Spousal Individual Accounts**: If each spouse has an individual HDHP (separate health plans), each spouse's HSA can be used for their own medical expenses and for dependents they claim on their tax return. Each HSA is considered individual, and the funds cannot be used interchangeably between spouses unless both are covered under a single family HDHP.<br>- **Children and Dependents**: HSA funds can be used for the qualified medical expenses of children or other dependents listed on the taxpayer's return, regardless of whether they are covered under the HDHP. Dependents from a previous relationship can also be included, as long as the taxpayer claims them on their tax return. \|                                                                                                |
| **Carryover**                     | - Unlike **Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)**, which have a "use-it-or-lose-it" provision, **HSA funds roll over indefinitely**. There is no expiration date for your balance. <br> - This feature allows you to build up a significant balance over time, especially if you're healthy in the early years and don't need to tap into the account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Portability**                   | - The account is **owned by you**, not your employer, meaning it is fully portable. If you change jobs or health plans, you can take your HSA with you.<br> - Even if you stop contributing to the HSA (e.g., if you move to a non-HDHP plan), you can still **use** the funds in the account for qualified medical expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Contribution Limits (2025)**    | - **Individual (self-only coverage)**: $4,300<br>- **Family (coverage for dependents)**: $8,550<br>- **Catch-up contributions (age 55 and older)**: $1,000 extra for individual or family coverage.<br>- Contributions can be made by both the employee and employer, but total contributions cannot exceed the annual limits.<br> - **Spousal Individual Accounts**: If each spouse has an individual HDHP (i.e., separate health plans), each can contribute up to the individual limit of $4,300 (plus catch-up contributions, if applicable) to their own HSA.<br> - **Joint Account for Married Couples**: If both spouses are covered under the same HDHP, they can contribute jointly to a single HSA, with the total family contribution limit of $8,550 (plus catch-up contributions, if applicable) applying to both combined contributions. Only one HSA is required in this case, and both spouses can access the funds for qualified medical expenses for themselves, each other, and dependents claimed on their tax return. |
| **Employer Contributions**        | - Employers can contribute to your HSA, which may be a benefit if offered by your employer.<br> - The **total contributions** (from both you and your employer) must not exceed the annual IRS limit.<br> - Employer contributions are not counted as taxable income for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Tax Benefits**                  | 1. **Pre-tax Contributions**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they are made (e.g., via payroll deductions). This means you pay less in federal income taxes. <br>2. **Tax-Free Growth**: Any interest or investment growth on the HSA balance is tax-deferred, meaning it is not taxed while the funds grow. <br>3. **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are **completely tax-free** (federal, state, and local taxes are all waived).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Investment Options**            | - Once your balance reaches a certain threshold (typically $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the HSA provider), you can **invest your funds** in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or other investment vehicles.<br>- This allows for **long-term growth potential**, especially if you intend to use the account for future healthcare costs (e.g., retirement medical expenses).<br>- Investment growth within the account is **tax-deferred**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Withdrawals**                   | - **For Qualified Medical Expenses**: Withdrawals are **tax-free** when used for qualifying medical, dental, and vision expenses, as defined by the IRS.<br> - **Non-Qualified Withdrawals (before age 65)**: Any non-medical withdrawals will be subject to both **income tax** and a **20% penalty**.<br> - **Non-Qualified Withdrawals (after age 65)**: After age 65, you can withdraw funds for any purpose without penalty, but the withdrawal will be **taxed as income** if not used for medical expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Reimbursements**                | - **Reimbursing yourself for out-of-pocket expenses**: If you pay for qualified medical expenses with personal funds (e.g., credit card, cash, check), you can reimburse yourself later from your HSA.<br> - **Timing of reimbursements**: You can reimburse yourself at any time for eligible expenses, as long as they were incurred after the HSA was established. You do not have to reimburse yourself in the same year the expense occurred, meaning you could pay out-of-pocket now and reimburse yourself years later (tax-free and penalty-free as long as the expense is qualified).<br> - **Keep records**: It's essential to keep records (receipts, invoices) of the expenses for tax purposes and to ensure that you are reimbursing only for qualified medical expenses.<br> - **Reimbursement flexibility**: You can use your HSA to reimburse for medical expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse, or your dependents (even if they're not covered under your HDHP).                                                   |

#### Social Security

- Assuming it will still a viable system in the future and functioning similar to its current payout scheme, it is important to understand [how the system works](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Social_Security).
- Social Security offers more income for waiting longer to begin receiving payouts, but this does not always mean a better [return on investment](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/social-security-roi/) which is why some may want to take social security as [early as possible](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/why-i-plan-to-collect-social-security-as-early-as-possible/) especially if unavoidable retirement income may cause social security income to be [taxed](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/social-security-tax-torpedo/) (again) later.

#### Key Differences
- **Pre-tax accounts** (e.g., Traditional IRA, 401(k)) provide **immediate tax benefits** through deductions at the time of contribution, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Post-tax accounts** (e.g., Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) do not provide a tax deduction at the time of contribution but offer **tax-free withdrawals** if conditions are met (e.g., 59½ and 5-year holding period for Roth IRAs).
- **HSAs** are unique in that they provide **tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals** for qualified medical expenses, and offer additional flexibility for post-retirement use for non-medical expenses after age 65.
- **Taxable Brokerage Accounts** do not provide any immediate tax benefits or tax-deferred growth. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and earnings are taxed at **capital gains rates** when assets are sold. There are **no withdrawal restrictions or age-related penalties**, but long-term gains may be taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

## Custodial Accounts for Minors
 Regarding children, there are multiple investment [options](https://www.moneycrashers.com/financial-accounts-open-child/) that parents/guardians may want to consider for their child before an IRA, such as a 529, UGMA, or UTMA. Still, considering there are currently no direct rollovers from these accounts to retirement accounts without taxes, penalties, or severe limitations, opening a custodial retirement account for a child and teaching them the concepts of compounding may encourage investing habits and provide a great start for their retirement.

| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act)**        | A custodial account that allows gifts of money, securities, and other assets to be made to a minor. The custodian manages the account until the minor reaches adulthood. **Tax Advantage**: Earnings are taxed at the child's potentially lower tax rate, rather than the parent's higher tax rate.                                | Transfers would generally be treated as a sale of assets, so capital gains tax could apply if the assets have appreciated. Any gains realized upon liquidation of the assets may be taxed as the child’s income.                 | If assets are liquidated before transfer, transaction fees may apply (e.g., brokerage fees for selling assets). However, there are typically no fees for in-kind transfers.                              |
| **UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)**    | Similar to UGMA, but broader in scope, allowing more types of assets to be transferred, including real estate and patents. **Tax Advantage**: Earnings are taxed at the minor's tax rate, which could be lower than that of the parent. This is similar to UGMA, but offers more asset flexibility.                                | Similar to UGMA, transferring assets to a retirement account typically involves a sale of the assets, triggering capital gains tax on any gains realized. Short-term or long-term capital gains tax may apply.                   | Similar to UGMA, fees would apply if assets are liquidated and sold before transferring to the retirement account, with possible account closure fees if moving assets out of the custodial institution. |
| **529 College Savings Plan**                  | A tax-advantaged savings plan specifically for education expenses. It allows for **tax-free growth** and **tax-free withdrawals** when used for qualified education expenses. **Tax Advantage**: Earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are tax-free.                                        | Funds cannot be directly transferred to a retirement account. Withdrawals for non-education purposes are subject to ordinary income tax on the earnings, plus a 10% penalty.                                                     | Typically no fees for transferring between 529 accounts. However, withdrawing funds may involve transaction fees or fees for closing the account if moving funds to a non-educational account.           |
| **Coverdell ESA (Education Savings Account)** | A tax-advantaged account similar to the 529 plan, but with a lower contribution limit. It can be used for education-related expenses for students under 30 years old. **Tax Advantage**: Contributions grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are tax-free.                                           | Similar to 529 plans, funds cannot be transferred directly to a retirement account. Withdrawals for non-education purposes will be taxed as ordinary income and subject to a 10% penalty on earnings.                            | Fees for transferring assets between Coverdell ESA accounts are generally minimal, but liquidation of assets to move to a non-retirement account may incur transaction fees.                             |
| **Custodial Brokerage Account**               | A taxable brokerage account managed by an adult on behalf of a minor, where the minor owns the investments when they reach adulthood. **Tax Advantage**: There is no specific tax advantage other than earnings are taxed at the minor's tax rate, but there are no tax deferrals like in retirement accounts.                     | If assets are liquidated to fund a retirement account, capital gains tax is triggered on any realized gains. Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate.                     | Liquidation of assets often involves transaction costs such as commissions or fees. Fees can also apply if assets are transferred out of the brokerage account or if the account is closed.              |
| **Custodial Trust Accounts**                  | A trust set up for a minor, where the custodian manages the assets until the minor reaches adulthood. The trust can hold various types of assets and can be more flexible than a custodial account. **Tax Advantage**: The tax treatment depends on the trust's structure. Income generated within the trust is generally taxable. | Similar to a brokerage account, liquidating the trust’s assets may trigger capital gains tax on any realized gains. The tax treatment depends on the type of trust, but generally, income generated within the trust is taxable. | Fees for transferring assets from a custodial trust may include transaction costs for asset liquidation, as well as legal or administrative fees, depending on the trust’s terms.                        |
