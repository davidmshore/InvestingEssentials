### Health Savings Account (HSA)
- [HSAs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) are similar to traditional IRAs in terms of their tax advantage with a few additional perks. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax free and may be drawn at any age. Otherwise, withdrawals used for non-medical expenses are taxed as ordinary income and subject to a penalty fee calculated as a percentage of the withdrawn amount. However, after the age of 65 there is no penalty for withdrawals for non-medical expenses, and these withdrawals are still taxed as ordinary income, just like a traditional IRA. Another difference from a traditional IRA, is that **required minimum distributions do not apply to HSAs**.
- Younger, healthy individuals can take advantage of generally lower medical expenses and the **triple tax advantage of tax free contributions, growth and withdrawal for qualified medical expenses**.
- Reimbursement rules for qualified medical expenses allow for the account holder to pay for medical expenses out of pocket and reimburse themselves at any point in the future, e.g., after the account has had time to compound and increase in value.
- There are caveats to opening and contributing to an HSA, like having a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). These plans have higher annual deductibles (minimum four figure dollar amounts for singles). The trade-off is that the monthly premiums for young people is often relatively cheap, so the extra money that would normally go toward paying higher premiums can be invested into an HSA to compound for future expenses. The value at any point in time of an HSA will depend on the assets the investor chooses to purchase, similar to a retirement account.

This is unlike Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), which are typically employer-owned. <br>- **No "use-it-or-lose-it" rule**: Unused funds carry over year after year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Carryover**                     | - Unlike **Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)**, which have a "use-it-or-lose-it" provision, **HSA funds roll over indefinitely**. There is no expiration date for your balance. <br> - This feature allows you to build up a significant balance over time, especially if you're healthy in the early years and don't need to tap into the account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Investment Options**            | - Once your balance reaches a certain threshold (typically $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the HSA provider), you can **invest your funds** in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or other investment vehicles.<br>- This allows for **long-term growth potential**, especially if you intend to use the account for future healthcare costs (e.g., retirement medical expenses).<br>- Investment growth within the account is **tax-deferred**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Withdrawals**                   | - **For Qualified Medical Expenses**: Withdrawals are **tax-free** when used for qualifying medical, dental, and vision expenses, as defined by the IRS.<br> - **Non-Qualified Withdrawals (before age 65)**: Any non-medical withdrawals will be subject to both **income tax** and a **20% penalty**.<br> - **Non-Qualified Withdrawals (after age 65)**: After age 65, you can withdraw funds for any purpose without penalty, but the withdrawal will be **taxed as income** if not used for medical expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Employer Contributions**        | - Employers can contribute to your HSA, which may be a benefit if offered by your employer.<br> - The **total contributions** (from both you and your employer) must not exceed the annual IRS limit.<br> - Employer contributions are not counted as taxable income for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Rollover**                      | - Funds **roll over year after year** and do not expire. <br> - There is no annual "use-it-or-lose-it" rule, so you can accumulate funds in your HSA to cover future medical expenses.<br> - This feature makes the HSA a powerful tool for **long-term savings**, as it can be used to cover future medical expenses, including those in retirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Portability**                   | - The account is **owned by you**, not your employer, meaning it is fully portable. If you change jobs or health plans, you can take your HSA with you.<br> - Even if you stop contributing to the HSA (e.g., if you move to a non-HDHP plan), you can still **use** the funds in the account for qualified medical expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Penalty for Non-Qualified Use** | - If you use your HSA funds for **non-medical expenses before age 65**, you will face:<br> **1. Income tax** on the amount withdrawn, and<br> **2. A 20% penalty** on the amount withdrawn.<br> - After age 65, there is **no penalty**, but you will still pay **income tax** if the funds are used for non-medical purposes (similar to IRA distributions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Reimbursements**                | - **Reimbursing yourself for out-of-pocket expenses**: If you pay for qualified medical expenses with personal funds (e.g., credit card, cash, check), you can reimburse yourself later from your HSA.<br> - **Timing of reimbursements**: You can reimburse yourself at any time for eligible expenses, as long as they were incurred after the HSA was established. You do not have to reimburse yourself in the same year the expense occurred, meaning you could pay out-of-pocket now and reimburse yourself years later (tax-free and penalty-free as long as the expense is qualified).<br> - **Keep records**: It's essential to keep records (receipts, invoices) of the expenses for tax purposes and to ensure that you are reimbursing only for qualified medical expenses.<br> - **Reimbursement flexibility**: You can use your HSA to reimburse for medical expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse, or your dependents (even if they're not covered under your HDHP). |

### Key Takeaways
- **Pre-tax accounts** (like Traditional IRA, 401(k)) provide **immediate tax benefits** through deductions at the time of contribution, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Post-tax accounts** (like Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) do not provide a tax deduction at the time of contribution but offer **tax-free withdrawals** if conditions are met (e.g., 59½ and 5-year holding period for Roth IRAs).
- **HSAs** are unique in that they provide **tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals** for qualified medical expenses, and offer additional flexibility for post-retirement use for non-medical expenses after age 65.
- **Taxable Brokerage Accounts** do not provide any immediate tax benefits or tax-deferred growth. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and earnings are taxed at **capital gains rates** when assets are sold. There are **no withdrawal restrictions or age-related penalties**, but long-term gains may be taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.
