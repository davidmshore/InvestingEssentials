#### Health Savings Account (HSA)
- [HSAs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) are similar to traditional IRAs in terms of their tax advantage with a few additional perks. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax free and may be drawn at any age. Otherwise, withdrawals used for non-medical expenses are taxed as ordinary income and subject to a penalty fee calculated as a percentage of the withdrawn amount. However, after age 65 there is no penalty for withdrawals for non-medical expenses, and these withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, just like a traditional IRA. Another difference from a traditional IRA, is that **required minimum distributions do not apply to HSAs**.
- The account value of an HSA at any point in time will depend on the market value of the investment assets the investor chooses to purchase, similar to a retirement or brokerage account.
- Younger, healthy individuals can take advantage of generally lower medical expenses and the **triple tax advantage of tax free contributions, growth and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses**. There are a few [states that do not honor the tax benefits at the state level](https://hsaforamerica.com/state-income-tax/). The one downside that applies to all HSA owners is that passing them on to a beneficiary other than a spouse means **the entire value of the HSA (principle and earnings) will be taxed as income for the beneficiary the year it is inherited**, with exception to pay the testator's outstanding medical bills. A spouse inherits an HSA tax-free.
- Reimbursement rules for qualified medical expenses allow for the account holder to pay for medical expenses out of pocket and reimburse themselves at any point in the future, e.g., after the account has had time to compound and increase in value. This is called *shoeboxing* in reference to organizing old receipts for safekeeping. Keep thorough records of medical bills for future reimbursement as this may be decades later. **Reimbursements are only allowed for medical expenses incurred after opening the HSA and not used for itemized tax deduction**.
- Eligibility requirements for opening and contributing to an HSA, include having a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), not being enrolled in Medicare or claimed as a dependent. These plans have higher annual deductibles (minimum four figure dollar amounts for singles) and maximum out of pocket expenses defined by the government. The trade-off is that the monthly premiums for young people are often relatively cheap and plans generally cover preventative services without having to meet the deductible, e.g., annual check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings. Assuming an individual only needs insurance for emergency events or low cost routine expenses, the extra money that would normally go toward paying higher premiums can be invested via an HSA to compound. Funds invested into an HSA are always eligible for medical expenses, even after switching to non-HDHP coverage. 
- It can be difficult to know you are making the right decision about health care, and every individual or family is different with regard to medical needs, dependent credits and eligible cost reductions, and premium caps. When planning for a worst case scenario or high cost medical event, consider the maximum out of pocket expense (OOP) and how soon an HSA can meet these levels.
	- For a simple example, we will look at a single, young, healthy investor who is only able contribute $3000 per year starting in 2025. The investor chooses to purchase low cost total market index funds with an average annual return of 7.5% which will result in approximately $12000 of tax free capital gains for medical expenses at the end of 10 years on top of the $30000 tax free principle to use for medical expenses, assuming the account has not been drawn from during this period. The gains alone should be enough to cover a major medical emergency that would require the health plan owner to pay the maximum annual OOP (estimated for inflation after 10 years) and should cover many non-HDHP OOP requirements as well.

- The Motley Fool provides a summary of [HSA-Eligible Expenses](https://www.fool.com/retirement/plans/hsa/eligible-expenses/). IRS [Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-969) -> Distributions From an HSA states:
>Qualified medical expenses are those expenses that would generally qualify for the medical and dental expenses deduction. These are explained in [Pub. 502, Medical and Dental Expenses](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-502).

If you change jobs or health plans, you can take your HSA with you.<br> - Even if you stop contributing to the HSA (e.g., if you move to a non-HDHP plan), you can still **use** the funds in the account for qualified medical expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Contribution Limits (2025)**                                                      | - **Individual (self-only coverage)**: $4,300<br>- **Family (coverage for dependents)**: $8,550<br>- **Catch-up contributions (age 55 and older)**: $1,000 extra for individual or family coverage.<br>- Contributions can be made by both the employee and employer, but total contributions cannot exceed the annual limits.<br> - **Spousal Individual Accounts**: If each spouse has an individual HDHP (i.e., separate health plans), each can contribute up to the individual limit of $4,300 (plus catch-up contributions, if applicable) to their own HSA.<br> - **Joint Account for Married Couples**: If both spouses are covered under the same HDHP, they can contribute jointly to a single HSA, with the total family contribution limit of $8,550 (plus catch-up contributions, if applicable) applying to both combined contributions. Only one HSA is required in this case, and both spouses can access the funds for qualified medical expenses for themselves, each other, and dependents claimed on their tax return.<br> - **Prorated Contributions**: Contributions can be prorated based on the number of months you are HSA-eligible. If you become eligible during the year, you can contribute a prorated amount based on the months you were eligible.<br> - **Last-Month Rule**: If you are HSA-eligible on December 1st, you can contribute the full annual limit for that year. However, you must remain HSA-eligible through December 31st of the following year to avoid penalties (known as the "testing period").<br> - **One-Time IRA-to-HSA Rollover**: You can make a one-time, tax-free rollover from an IRA to an HSA, which counts towards the annual contribution limit. This rollover is limited to one per lifetime and requires HSA eligibility. If you make this rollover, you must remain HSA-eligible for 12 months after the rollover to avoid penalties. This rollover allows you to fund your HSA using IRA assets without triggering taxes or penalties. |

This means you pay less in federal income taxes. <br>2. **Tax-Free Growth**: Any interest or investment growth on the HSA balance is tax-deferred, meaning it is not taxed while the funds grow. <br>3. **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are **completely tax-free** (federal, state, and local taxes are all waived).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Social Security

- Assuming it will still a viable system in the future and functioning similar to its current payout scheme, it is important to understand [how the system works](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Social_Security). In some states, government employees may not be eligible for social security withholdings, and it will be important to understand the alternative options offered by your state.
- Social Security offers more income for waiting longer to begin receiving payouts, but this does not always mean a better [return on investment](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/social-security-roi/) which is why some may want to take social security as [early as possible](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/why-i-plan-to-collect-social-security-as-early-as-possible/) especially if unavoidable retirement income may cause social security income to be [taxed](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/social-security-tax-torpedo/) (again) later.

| **Weighted Benefits Calculation**           | - Social Security benefits are calculated using a formula that weights earnings more heavily for lower-income workers. This progressive formula ensures that lower earners receive a higher percentage of their pre-retirement income compared to higher earners. <br> - The calculation is based on your **highest 35 years** of earnings, adjusted for inflation. These years are used to determine your **Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)**, which is then applied to a formula to calculate your **Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)**.                                                                                                 |

### Pensions
- A pension plan in the traditional sense, i.e. defined benefit plan, is a type of retirement plan where an employer contributes money over time to provide income during retirement based on factors like salary and years of service. The employer is responsible for managing the planâ€™s investments and ensuring thereâ€™s enough money to cover the promised benefits. Typically the guaranteed benefits are weighted, i.e. get increasingly better, as an employee's annual income increases with the number of years worked at an organization, and require an employee to work a certain number of years in order to receive them.
- Pension plans were the standard retirement plan for both government and private employees of large corporations from post-WWII thru the early 1980s when new plans and contributions began to taper in the private sector. Today, pensions are still common for public employees, but some government organizations may only offer a defined contribution plan, such as a 403(b) or 457(b), which leaves the responsibility for retirement planning up to the employee.
- Depending on the plan, funding can be with pre-tax or post-tax dollars. Likewise, distributions during retirement can be paid on a monthly schedule, lump sum, or transferred to an IRA.
- The Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) was introduced in 1978 as a hybrid pension plan. Only the employer contributes, and contributions must be given to each employee equally, but the employee manages the investments like a traditional IRA.

#### Key Differences
- **Pre-tax accounts** (e.g., Traditional IRA, 401(k)) provide **immediate tax benefits** through deductions at the time of contribution, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Post-tax accounts** (e.g., Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) do not provide a tax deduction at the time of contribution but offer **tax-free withdrawals** if conditions are met (e.g., 59Â½ and 5-year holding period for Roth IRAs).
- **HSAs** are unique in that they provide **tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals** for qualified medical expenses, and offer additional flexibility for post-retirement use for non-medical expenses after age 65.
- **Taxable Brokerage Accounts** do not provide any immediate tax benefits or tax-deferred growth. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and earnings are taxed at **capital gains rates** when assets are sold. There are **no withdrawal restrictions or age-related penalties**, but long-term gains may be taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

## Education and Minors
 Regarding children, there are multiple investment [options](https://www.moneycrashers.com/financial-accounts-open-child/) that parents/guardians may want to consider for their child before an IRA, such as a [529](https://clark.com/529), UGMA, or UTMA. Still, considering the limited rollover option for 529s only to Roth retirement accounts, opening a custodial retirement account for a child and teaching them about savings and compounding may encourage investing habits and provide a great start for their retirement. Avoid using life insurance policies to save for education expenses.

| **UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act)**        | A custodial account that allows gifts of money, securities, and other assets to be made to a minor. The custodian manages the account until the minor reaches adulthood. **Tax Advantage**: Earnings are taxed at the child's potentially lower tax rate, rather than the parent's higher tax rate.                                | Transfers would generally be treated as a sale of assets, so capital gains tax could apply if the assets have appreciated. Any gains realized upon liquidation of the assets may be taxed as the childâ€™s income.                                                                                                                                                                                           | If assets are liquidated before transfer, transaction fees may apply (e.g., brokerage fees for selling assets). However, there are typically no fees for in-kind transfers.                              |
| **UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)**    | Similar to UGMA, but broader in scope, allowing more types of assets to be transferred, including real estate and patents. **Tax Advantage**: Earnings are taxed at the minor's tax rate, which could be lower than that of the parent. This is similar to UGMA, but offers more asset flexibility.                                | Similar to UGMA, transferring assets to a retirement account typically involves a sale of the assets, triggering capital gains tax on any gains realized. Short-term or long-term capital gains tax may apply.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Similar to UGMA, fees would apply if assets are liquidated and sold before transferring to the retirement account, with possible account closure fees if moving assets out of the custodial institution. |
| **529 College Savings Plan**                  | A tax-advantaged savings plan specifically for education expenses. It allows for **tax-free growth** and **tax-free withdrawals** when used for qualified education expenses. **Tax Advantage**: Earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are tax-free.                                        | Withdrawals for non-education purposes are subject to ordinary income tax on the earnings, plus a 10% penalty. However, beginning in 2024, a provision allows up to $35,000 to be rolled over from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary over their lifetime, **without taxes and penalties**, subject to Roth IRA annual contribution limits and the 529 account being open for at least 15 years. | Typically no fees for transferring between 529 accounts. However, withdrawing funds may involve transaction fees or fees for closing the account if moving funds to a non-educational account.           |
| **Coverdell ESA (Education Savings Account)** | A tax-advantaged account similar to the 529 plan, but with a lower contribution limit. It can be used for education-related expenses for students under 30 years old. **Tax Advantage**: Contributions grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are tax-free.                                           | Funds cannot be transferred directly to a retirement account.
