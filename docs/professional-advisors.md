Financial advisors are a valuable resource. While advisors can act as managers, a savvy investor should not think of them this way. Their value is primarily in their expertise about the law and explaining the best options available to help you see how different scenarios can potential play out. This is especially true approaching retirement or estate planning for their tax expertise, or for a mid-life checkup, or when complex new options become available to investors, which are rare, just to make sure that you are on the right path toward your retirement goals. For new investors who feel they still need an advisor, the proliferation of AI and robo-advisors is the lowest cost and simplest way to get assistance. 

Aside from expertise and reputation, the fee structure an advisor uses is the next most important factor. Remember, investing overhead is the primary factor that will determine how much an account grows over time.

Before meeting a financial advisor, try to find answers yourself. This will help narrow down the most relevant and important questions you may have and better prepare you for a meeting.

There are three main types of advisors.

- **Commission advisors**
	- Some products are only sold on a commission basis, e.g., life insurance, but this generally is not true of investment products.
- **Fee-only**
	- This can be an hourly rate or a percentage of assets under management (AUM). The latter price plan is what investors want to avoid over the long term.
- **Financial planning**
	- Planners only provide advice. This can be charged as a flat or hourly rate depending on the goals of the investor.
- Fee-based
	- These advisors combine fee-only structure to manage an investor's account while also receiving a commission for investment products they sell.
- Robo-advisors
	- Algorithmic investment plans are now common and will recommend a plan based on a series of questions. These are a great option for new investors who do not want to learn about investing on their own.
- There are too many advisor certifications and titles to keep track of them all, but some of the most common are:
	- Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)
		- RIAs must be licensed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell investments and must act as an investor's fiduciary <!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. They can be fee-only or fee-based.
	- Certified Financial Planner (CFP)
		- CFPs must pass exams covering many investment topics and have 3 years of qualified experience, follow a code of ethics, must act as an investor's fiduciary, and keep up their continuing education annually.
	- Chartered Financial analysts (CFA)
		- CFAs must also cover a series of exams and have 3 years of qualified work experience. 
	- Chartered Financial Consultant (CFC) 
		- ChFPs must also cover a series of exams and have 3 years of qualified work experience.
	- Certified public accountants (CPA)
		- CPAs specialize in tax preparation.
- Some advisors only work with high net worth clients or investors nearing retirement.
- Estate planning generally garners the second highest legal fees on the market. Attorneys working for larger firms typically cost more and give clients access to the highest caliber of experienced attorneys. However, sometimes experienced attorneys leave these firms to set up shop on their own at more competitive rates. For lower net worth testators, the latter may be worth the effort of finding.
- The easiest way to ensure an advisor is adhering to the highest ethical standards is to use a **fee-only or fee-based fiduciary**<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> at the most competitive rate for the particular service needed. The key here is the overall cost to the investor, because an advisor acting as a fiduciary is simply advising what they think is best for their client without putting their own interest ahead of the client.
