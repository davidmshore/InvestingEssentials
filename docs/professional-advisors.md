## Financial Advisors
Financial advisors are a valuable resource. While advisors can act as managers, a savvy investor should not think of them this way. Their value is primarily in their expertise about the law and explaining the best options available to help you see how different scenarios can potential play out. This is especially true approaching retirement or estate planning for their tax expertise, for a mid-life checkup, after receiving a windfall, or any complex new option becomes available to you as an investor to make sure that you are on the right path toward your financial goals. For new investors who feel like learning for them is too much, the proliferation of AI and robo-advisors is the lowest cost and simplest way to get assistance through simple question and answer interfaces.

Aside from expertise and reputation, the fee structure an advisor uses is the next most important factor. Remember that investment product returns, overhead costs, and taxes are the primary factors that will determine how much an account grows over time.

There are three main types of advisors.

- **Commission advisors**
	- Some products are only sold on a commission basis, e.g., life insurance, but this is not true of investment products.
- **Fee-only**
	- This can be an hourly rate or a percentage of assets under management (AUM). The latter price plan is what investors want to avoid over the long term.
- **Financial planning**
	- Planners only provide advice. This can be charged as a flat or hourly rate depending on the goals of the investor.
- Fee-based
	- These advisors combine fee-only structure to manage an investor's account while also receiving a commission for investment products they sell.
- Robo-advisors
	- Algorithmic investment plans are now common and can not only recommend a plan but also manage your portfolio based on a series of questions. These are a great option for new investors who do not want to learn beyond the basics and plenty of experienced investors value the modern convenience and lower advisor cost. 
- There are too many advisor certifications and titles to keep track of them all, but some of the most common are:
	- Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)
		- RIAs must be licensed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell investments and must act as an investor's fiduciary<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> according to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. They can be fee-only or fee-based.
	- Certified Financial Planner (CFP)
		- CFPs must pass exams covering many investment topics and have sufficient qualified work experience generally taking about 3 years to complete, follow a code of ethics, and keep up mandatory continuing education.
	- Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA)
		- CFAs must pass exams covering many investment topics and have sufficient qualified work experience taking a minimum of 3 years to complete, follow a code of ethics, and keep up mandatory continuing education. 
	- Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) 
		- ChFCs must pass exams covering many investment topics and have sufficient qualified work experience taking a minimum of 3 years to complete, follow a code of ethics, and keep up mandatory continuing education.
	- Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
		- CPAs specialize in tax preparation.
		- Certain CPAs specialize in personal financial services (PFS). The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants provides this designation.
- Some advisors only work with high net worth clients or investors nearing retirement.
- The easiest way to ensure an advisor is adhering to the highest ethical standards is to use a **fee-based or fee-only fiduciary who offers their services at a fixed or hourly fee**<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. It is rare to find an advisor who only has this price model or offers an hourly rate for just a few hours. They will likely have a minimum number of hours that must be met, a flat fee that starts in the thousands, or offer an AUM price structure. A fiduciary is simply advising what they think is best for their client without putting their own interest first. You still need to make sure an advisor's expertise sounds well worth it for your particular planning needs, and understand that a flat fee will generally pay for the creation of a suitable investment plan that you will manage. 
	- An advisor who wants to charge an AUM fee will certainly want to maximize their clients' account growth, but they will also be taking a decent sized chunk off the top every year. If an AUM advisor can back up their claims of better after-fee returns with *actual examples of their method used for existing clients from multiple long-term historical periods equivalent to your investing timeline and more importantly articulate their method in a way you understand*, give it some consideration. Some of the sales pitch will probably focus around risk management, but remember that this is not as important throughout the majority of an investor's accumulation phase as it is when nearing retirement or whenever the funds will be needed. Remember, there are lazy portfolios that investors can follow for each phase of financial planning, such Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio that aims to protect earnings later in life.

## Estate Planning
Passing assets onto heirs is definitely something that investors with substantial net worth should seek professional advice on. Advisors mentioned above may be well educated on helping make sure your wishes are met, and the process will also require an attorney. A trusted financial advisor or CPA should be able to assist you in finding a reputable attorney in your area. Estate planning is generally billed at flat rates.
