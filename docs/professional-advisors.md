Financial advisors are a valuable resource, especially early on for helping plan how to maximize returns that fit your retirement goals. While advisors can act as managers, a savvy investor who understands the importance of keeping their account costs low should not think of them this way. Their value to you is primarily in their expertise about the law and explaining the best options available to help you see how different scenarios can potential play out.

Aside from expertise and reputation, the fee structure an advisor uses is the next most important factor. Remember, low overhead is the primary factor that will determine how much an account grows over time.

Before meeting a financial advisor, try to find answers yourself. This will help narrow down the most relevant and important questions you may have and better prepare you for a meeting.

There are three main types of advisors.

- **Commission advisors**
	- Some products are only sold on a commission basis, e.g., life insurance, but this generally is not true of investment products.
- **Fee-only**
	- This can be an hourly rate or a percentage of assets under management (AUM). The latter price plan is what an investor wants to avoid over the long term.
- **Financial planning**
	- Planners only provide advice. This can be charged a flat or hourly rate depending on the goals of the investor.
- Fee-based
	- These advisors combine fee-only structure to manage an investor's account while also receiving a commission for investment products they sell.
- Robo-advisors
	- Algorithmic investment plans are now common and will recommend an plan based on a series of questions. 
- There are too many advisor certifications and titles to understand them all, but some of the most common are:
	- Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)
		- RIAs must be licensed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell investments and must act as an investor's fiduciary <!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. They can be fee-only or fee-based.
	- Certified Financial Planner (CFP)
		- CFPs must pass exams covering many investment topics and have 3 years of qualified experience, follow code of ethics and keep up their continuing education annually.
	- Chartered financial analysts (CFA)
		- CFAs must also cover a series of exams have 3 years of qualified work experience. 
	- Chartered Financial Consultant (CFC) 
		- ChFPs must also cover a series of exams have 3 years of qualified work experience.
	- Certified public accountants (CPA)
		- CPAs specialize in tax preparation.
- Some advisors only work with high net worth clients, i.e., nearing retirement.

Most of the advisor advice was provided by Laura Adam's from episode 885 of the Money Girl Podcast.
