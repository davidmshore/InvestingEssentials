## Keep it Simple
The r/personalfinance Wiki's [Prime Directive flowchart](https://imgur.com/personal-income-spending-flowchart-united-states-lSoUQr2) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) is an excellent guide as well as the Bogleheads' Wiki on [prioritizing investments](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments). Open the flowchart in a separate tab to zoom in. There are plenty of other [sources](../resources/main.md#blogs)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> that elaborate on this kind of advice if you would like more information, so pick one that resonates with you and follow along. Avoid ones that are outdated or require payment for advice. A few that seem to have a good reputation on Reddit are Mr. Money Mustache, Money Guy, and Mad Fientist. For the average investor, try to stay focused on the financial principles and do not get discouraged on not being able to achieve the same end result, such as reaching early retirement at the same age, or at all, becoming fully financially independence, being able to make use of the travel tricks, etc.

See [Portfolio Allocation](portfolio-allocation.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for common practice on how to allocate investment capital within accounts based on age. Starting out with a plan to age into a lower percentage of equity holdings in one's portfolio is recommended for most investors. Along the way begin learning about strategies for getting through recessions during retirement, such as [leveraging low interest debt](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/debt-as-a-recession-tool/) and holding a higher percentage of interest earning investments and dividend stocks.

Review the [summarized portfolio characteristics and investing tips](../resources/main.md#summarized-portfolio-characteristics-and-investing-tips)<!-- #internal_link -->, the most important of which are: start investing as early as possible, prevent tax drag in taxable accounts as much as possible, invest in funds with low expense ratios, avoid advisor fees and commissions as much as possible, and contribute earned income on a routine basis during working years.

Read the articles, [Traditional vs Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth) from the Bogleheads and [The Great Roth Controversy](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/) by GoCurryCracker! for help with choosing which retirement account (pre-tax versus post-tax) to focus on and how much to allocate to each. Another [article](https://wantfi.com/skip-the-roth-ira-and-401k-pay-less-tax.html) from WantFi gives a few more examples to drive home the argument by GoCurryCracker! Consider your planned retirement date and how much money is expected to be in traditional accounts.

- It really comes down to your effective tax rate now and the estimated rate during retirement, so make sure your understanding of effective tax rate<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> is sound. The average investor will have a lower effective tax rate during retirement. However, there are many more considerations for high earners, such as early retirement, estate planning, substantially high taxes on RMDs if they do retire early, no RMDs for Roth accounts, SEPP withdrawals, how many years left for a Roth ladder conversion, etc.

To understand the significance of an expense ratio and commissions taken as a percentage of account value, remember that compound growth increases the value of an account by a percentage of the current account value on a periodic basis. Therefore, as the compound rate of return is lowered by management expenses and fees, there will be less money growth.

	- The same calculation can be ran for any investment value, period, and rate of return to match your scenario.
		- The formula is **MV = P * ( 1 + r )^n**
			- MV is the maturity value
			- P is the principal amount
			- r is the rate of return
			- n is the number of compounding intervals from the time of the date of deposit until maturity
	- Here's a [compound growth calculator that accounts for the expense ratio](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/expense-ratio#how-much-does-the-expense-ratio-cost-you) and will return the maturity value and total fees paid over the life of an investment.
	- Page 115 (PDF page 142) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) gives an example of how easily unnecessary costs can get out of hand.

- There are retirement calculators aplenty, but it might be best to get familiar with building your own using a spreadsheet or becoming familiar with one of the community provided ones. LibreOffice Calc is free and Microsoft users might already have access to Excel. Links to [online calculators](../resources/tools.md#net-worth-distribution-estimators)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> and [prebuilt spreadsheets](../resources/tools.md#more-calculators-and-budgeting-tools)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> are available in Resources.
