## Keep It Simple
The r/personalfinance Wiki's [Prime Directive flowchart](https://imgur.com/personal-income-spending-flowchart-united-states-lSoUQr2) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) is an excellent guide as well as the Bogleheads' Wiki on [prioritizing investments](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments). Open the flowchart in a separate tab to zoom in. There are plenty of other [sources](../resources/main.md#blogs)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> that elaborate on this kind of advice if you would like more information, so pick one that resonates with you and follow along. Avoid ones that are outdated or require payment for advice. A few that seem to have a good reputation on Reddit are Mr. Money Mustache, Money Guy, Mad Fientist and GoCurryCracker!. For the average investor, try to stay focused on the financial principles and do not get discouraged on not being able to achieve the same end result, such as reaching early retirement at the same age, if at all, becoming fully financially independent, being able to make use of the travel tricks, etc. Clark Howard, Laura Adams and Money Guy are well rounded choices for investors focused on more than early retirement.

Mutual funds and ETFs that are commonly used for creating a two or three-fund portfolio can be found [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). See [Asset Allocation](asset-allocation.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for general guidelines on how to allocate capital within a portfolio based on age. Planning to age into a lower percentage of equity holdings is recommended for most investors. Along the way, begin learning about strategies for getting through recessions during retirement, such as [leveraging low interest debt](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/debt-as-a-recession-tool/) and holding a higher percentage of interest earning investments and dividend stocks.

Read the articles, [Traditional vs Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth) from the Bogleheads and [The Great Roth Controversy](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/) by GoCurryCracker! for help with choosing which tax advantaged account(s) to focus on and when and how much to allocate to each. Another [article](https://wantfi.com/skip-the-roth-ira-and-401k-pay-less-tax.html) from WantFi gives a few more examples to drive home the argument by GoCurryCracker! Consider your planned retirement date and how much money you estimate will be in traditional accounts.

- It really comes down to your [effective tax rate](../glossary.md#effective-tax-rate)<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> now and the estimated rate during retirement, so make sure your understanding of your effective tax rate is sound. The average investor will have a lower effective tax rate during retirement. However, there are more considerations for high earners, such as early retirement/withdrawals, estate planning, substantially high taxes on RMDs, no RMDs for Roth accounts, backdoor Roths, after tax contributions to traditional retirement accounts, etc.

## Minimize Management Cost
Minimal cost equates to maximum growth. The total cost of owning a fund is the sum of the [expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios), load, commission or any other fee taken as a percentage of account value plus any transaction fee. Ever since John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, introduced low cost index funds to investors in 1976, other funds have been created with competitive prices. These funds come with very little overhead and the cost of owning them can generally be compared by looking at the expense ratio. Remember that compound growth increases the value of an account by a percentage of the current account value on a periodic basis. Therefore, as the rate of return is lowered by management expenses and fees, there will be less money growth. This becomes much more significant as an account balance enters the six digit range and beyond. 

- [READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sph67r/trying_to_understand_the_math_of_mutual_fund_fees/) before considering a managed account or any other with high fees.
	- The same calculation can be ran for any investment value, period, and rate of return to match your scenario.
		- The formula for compound growth is **MV = P * ( 1 + r /n )^nt**
			- (MV) is the maturity value (principal + interest)
			- (P) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
			- (r) is the annual interest rate (decimal)
			- (n) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year
			- (t) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.
	- Here's a [compound growth calculator that accounts for the expense ratio](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/expense-ratio#how-much-does-the-expense-ratio-cost-you) and will return the maturity value and total fees paid over the life of an investment. The [inflation adjusted rate of return](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/real-rate-of-return) can be calculated using an [inflation rate](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp) of your choice and plugged into the growth calculator for a more accurate estimate of future buying power. 
- Page 115 (PDF page 142) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) gives an example of how easily unnecessary costs can get out of hand.
- [What Is a Good Expense Ratio for Mutual Funds?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/when-expense-ratio-considered-high-and-when-it-considered-low.asp) (investopedia.com)
- When investing in multiple funds, the costs associated with a particular fund only applies to the money invested in that fund, and the effective cost of owning multiple funds must be calculated similar to calculating an effective tax rate.
	- **Effective cost = Total expense / Total investments * 100%**
- In 2018, Fidelity was the first brokerage to offer no-cost index fund investing with no minimum investment. No catches, except that the funds are proprietary and cannot be transferred to another broker. Funds must be sold before moving, which only carries a tax bill if held in a taxable brokerage account, not a retirement or other tax advantaged account if transferred within the 60-day window.
- For investors considering a fund of funds <!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> with a target retirement date, a 0.2%-0.5% expense ratio including automatic rebalancing is considered acceptable per the Bogleheads', which can be considered a maximum for any portfolio management costs. For comparison, the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares mutual fund (VTWAX) has an expense ratio of 0.10%, and the ETF version is just 0.07%. So, assess the convenience cost of automatic rebalancing and if it is worth it to you in the end.

## Manage Efficiently
Review the summarized list of portfolio characteristics and investing tips below. The ones every investor should adhere to are: start investing as early as possible, max out tax advantaged accounts first, prevent tax drag in taxable accounts, invest in low cost diversified funds, avoid excessive advisor fees and commissions as much as possible, and contribute earned income on a routine basis during working years, increasing the amount as more income is earned.

The following criteria may or may not apply to an investor's strategy and may apply at different periods throughout the life of an investor:

- Avoid managed accounts. The fees may not sound like much, but they reduce the amount of capital available for compound growth. This can amount to years worth of retirement income, which will result in the investor either having to reduce their standard of retirement living or work longer to save up additional income. Instead, invest in low cost index funds.
- The value of a financial advisor is their expertise about the law and explaining the best options available to help you see how different scenarios can potential play out. If seeking professional help, look for a certified financial planner that offers their service for a flat fee or time-based price structure. This way the exchange for their time is of more equal value than paying an annual commission for your money to sit in an investment account that will likely be semi or fully automated for the average investor.
- Avoid tax drag. Generally accomplished through the use of tax advantaged accounts. This can become more nuanced if an investor plans to retire early and must understand SEPP rules and possibly utilize income from other sources of income. 
	- Use tax advantaged accounts. 401K, 403b, IRAs, etc. There many different options for workers and their spouses through company plans.
- Least tax efficient funds<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> should go in tax advantaged accounts, e.g., mutual funds, high-yield bonds, dividend focused funds. 
- Most tax efficient funds in taxable account.
	- Use tax efficient index funds like ETFs.
	- Keep mutual fund [turnover](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021616/what-good-turnover-ratio-mutual-fund.asp) low. Try to buy funds with very low turnover to avoid taxable events. Turnover frequency needs to be over one year to take advantage of long term capital gains.
	- Funds having the fewest dividend assets.
	- Low dividend yield funds.
	- Qualified dividends are more tax efficient than ordinary dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed as long term capital gains rather than ordinary income.
	- Stocks with qualified dividends are better placed in taxable accounts, while stocks with ordinary dividend yields, which are taxed as ordinary income, are better placed in tax advantaged accounts.
	- [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/) lists distribution statistics of a fund under Performance -> Distributions:
		- Income = dividends/interest
		- S/T Cap Gain = short term capital gain
		- L/T Cap Gain = long term capital gain
		- Values are listed in dollars distributed from the NAV (including ETFs).
- The tax efficiency of different assets is found on [page 140](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) of the The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing (PDF page 167).
- Assuming that when comparing funds to invest in, each are equally diversified, the expense ratio is generally the #1 indicator of how well a fund will perform over time as long as there are no other transactions fees or hidden expenses.
- Morningstar.com provides a tax cost ratio of 3, 5, 10, and 15 year periods.
- 401(k) plan details about fees and expenses are provided in Summary Plan Descriptions. Form 5500 does not show individual account expenses, but additional documents may be requested from an employer about how much they are paying.
	- 401(k) plans may not offer the lowest cost investing options, but they are usually still the best retirement account to max out first up to the employer match, if a generous employer match is offered. 
- The prospectus for potential investments should be used to confirm the performance and associated expenses.
- Use tax harvesting in taxable accounts, meaning take advantage of lower income years when the sale of securities for a gain will result in lower, or zero taxes, and/or selling securities at a loss can help offset capital gains tax. Then either wait 31 days to repurchase the same or substantially similar securities or purchase dissimilar ones to avoid a wash sale<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> and be careful that automatic reinvestment of dividends does not trigger a wash sale. This practice effectively increases the cost basis (original purchase price of an asset) so that tax on future capital gains of the same securities will be lower. The median portfolio that used loss harvesting added about 20% to its value over what purely passive investing did.
- Use HIFO (highest in, first out accounting method), which is removing the assets that have shown the least returns or highest loss from an account, when trying to minimize taxes. This is possible through specific identification of shares. Accounting cost basis settings can be changed for each brokerage account.
- Buy fund shares after the distribution date (the date when annual taxable distributions are paid).
- Sell fund shares before the distribution date.
- Sell profitable shares after the new year if tax harvesting allows it (generally, there is no sense paying taxes earlier than needed).
- Regarding bonds, per the 2014 publishing of The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing, it is advised to use a bond advisor due to deceptive restricted clauses and hidden fees in certain bond types (e.g., corporate bonds). An exception would be using treasurydirect.com that offers direct issues of US government bonds to end users.
- Avoid timing the market and contribute earned income on a scheduled basis.
- Be prepared to pass on assets by having legal instructions written up in a will or trust and named beneficiaries for retirement accounts. 

## Achieving Goals
- Write down your goals.
	- Follow an [investment policy statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement), and/or
	- Use the [SMART](https://www.google.com/search?q=smart+goals+method+explained&sca_esv=c137534a6bb4ed6f&source=hp&ei=HduNZ4ipCbi40PEPxqOp8Qo&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZ43pLb20yEAO4WglfMQnj33xdHaUpHX1&ved=0ahUKEwjIq6blxIOLAxU4HDQIHcZRKq4Q4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=smart+goals+method+explained&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IhxzbWFydCBnb2FscyBtZXRob2QgZXhwbGFpbmVkMgYQABgWGB4yCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBTIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIESIQBUABYAHAAeACQAQCYAV-gAV-qAQExuAEDyAEA-AEC-AEBmAIBoAJlmAMAkgcDMC4xoAf2Aw&sclient=gws-wiz) method for goals.

	- Check progress annually using a [net worth calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/net-worth-calculator).
		- A spreadsheet file or app is preferred to an online calculator as it allows you to measure your progress easier. Integrated budgeting apps such as Mint, Empower (formerly Personal Capital), or [alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=alternatives+to+mint+for+net+worth+tracking&cId=bfe2e1f7-be67-4d14-b3e6-e063bb036759&iId=14ed36eb-a5a6-4997-b116-d8bb1e387ef0) add convenience.

- Track cash flow by creating and following a budget/spending plan.
- Do not make a spending plan so strict that it cuts out all luxuries. Instead use low cost luxuries.
- Along with cost efficient luxuries, reward yourself with a small reward when milestones are met.
- Share your goals with someone who will keep you accountable.
	- There are online [forums and groups](../resources/main.md#forums-wikis)<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->in addition to personal connections if needed.

- There are retirement calculators aplenty that will provide good account balance estimations. If you are analytical in nature or aiming to live out retirement on a rather modest budget it might be best to get familiar with building your own spreadsheets, or one of the community provided ones. LibreOffice Calc is free and Microsoft users might already have access to Excel. Links to [online calculators](../resources/tools.md#net-worth-distribution-estimators)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> and [prebuilt spreadsheets](../resources/tools.md#more-calculators-and-budgeting-tools)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> are available in Resources.
