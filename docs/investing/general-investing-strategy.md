## How Investing Is Different From Most of Life
 These quotes are perfect for setting the right mindset.

> In school, it usually takes a lot of work to earn an A, less work to earn a B, and so on. In investing, if you spend lots of time and effort studying the market, or pay someone to manage your investments, you have less than a 20 percent chance of being an A investor. However, if you know nothing about investing, spend minimal time on your investments, and buy index funds, you have a 100 percent chance of being a B investor. In a world where most investors get a D or worse, B is beautiful.
> 
> Through education and experience, most of us come to learn and practice certain life principles that serve us well. For example:
> 
> - Don’t settle for average. Strive to be the best.
> - Listen to your gut. What you feel in your heart is ususally right.
> - If you don’t know how to do something, ask. Talk to an expert or hire one and let the expert handle it. That will save you a lot of time and frustration.
> - You get what you pay for. Good help isn’t cheap and cheap help isn’t good.
> - If there’s a crisis, take action! Do something to fix it.
> - History repeats itself. The best predictor of future performance is past performance.
> 
> Well, guess what? Applying these principles to investing is destined to leave you poorer. As an investor you can be well above average by settling for slightly less than the index returns.

## Keep It Simple
The r/personalfinance Wiki's [Prime Directive flowchart](https://imgur.com/personal-income-spending-flowchart-united-states-lSoUQr2) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) is an excellent guide as well as the Bogleheads' Wiki on [prioritizing investments](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments). Open the flowchart in a separate tab to zoom in. There are plenty of other [sources](../resources/main.md#blogs)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> that elaborate on this kind of advice if you would like more information. Just pick one that resonates with you and follow along. Avoid ones that are outdated or require payment. A few that seem to have a good reputation on Reddit are Mr. Money Mustache, Money Guy, Mad Fientist and GoCurryCracker! For the average investor, try to stay focused on the financial principles and do not get discouraged on not being able to achieve the same end result as others, e.g., reaching early retirement at the same age, if at all, becoming fully financially independent, being able to make use of travel tricks, etc. Clark Howard, Laura Adams and Money Guy are well rounded choices for investors focused on more than early retirement.

Ideally, you want to maximize returns at the lowest possible risk. But it is important to make sure that your definition of risk is appropriate for your stage in investing. The exact same investment for two people who are 40 years apart in age will pose drastically different risks to one's portfolio. Review [Market History And Performance](../market-history-and-performance.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for a reminder of the true risk of a recession, or even depression, in light of having access to the world market and possibly decades of time to recover.

Mutual funds and ETFs that are commonly used for creating a two or three-fund portfolio can be found [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). Using the fewest funds makes [asset allocation](asset-allocation.md)<!-- #internal_link --> slightly simpler. Planning to age into a lower percentage of equity holdings is recommended for most investors. Along the way, continue learning about strategies for getting through recessions during retirement, such as [leveraging low interest debt](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/debt-as-a-recession-tool/), taking advantage of fixed income securities, having a backup part-time job in mind, and of course efficient spending on whatever comes up in life.

Read the articles, [Traditional vs Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth) from the Bogleheads and [The Great Roth Controversy](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/) by GoCurryCracker! for help with choosing which tax-advantaged account(s) to focus on and when and how much to allocate to each. Another [article](https://wantfi.com/skip-the-roth-ira-and-401k-pay-less-tax.html) from WantFi gives a few more examples to drive home the argument by GoCurryCracker! Consider your planned retirement date and how much money you estimate will be in traditional accounts.

- It really comes down to your [effective tax rate](../glossary.md#effective-tax-rate)<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> now and the estimated rate during retirement, so make sure your understanding of your effective tax rate is sound. The average investor will have a lower effective tax rate during retirement. However, there are more considerations for high earners, such as early retirement/withdrawals, estate planning, substantially high taxes on RMDs, no RMDs for Roth accounts, after tax contributions to traditional retirement accounts, backdoor Roth conversions, etc.
	- See [Resources -> Tools -> Income Tax Calculators](../resources/tools.md#income-tax-calculators)<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->.
## Minimize Cost
Minimal cost equates to maximum growth. The total cost of owning a fund is the sum of the [expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios), load, commission or any other fee taken as a percentage of account value plus any transaction fee. Ever since John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, introduced low cost index funds to investors in 1976, competitor funds have been created with similar low prices. These funds come with very little overhead and the cost of owning them can generally be compared by looking at the expense ratio. In fact the funds that are recommended for following the Boglehead strategy should have a total cost equal to the expense ratio—there should be no other fees, unless required as part of a workplace plan. 

Remember that compound growth increases the value of an account by a percentage of the current account value on a periodic basis. Therefore, as the rate of return is lowered by management expenses and fees, there will be less money growth. This becomes much more significant as an account balance enters the six digit range and beyond. 

A fund's expense ratio can be found in the front of its prospectus. To confirm there are no additional fees, look for a tab or link labeled *Fees* on a fund's webpage. As mentioned previously, funds managed by a broker that you purchase directly from them typically incur the least overall expense, including zero dollar commissions and transaction fees for ETFs and mutual funds. To see how much overhead can be avoided, see Page 109 (PDF page 136) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up). It may not be possible to keep the expenses as low as you would like with benefit plans, but always look through the prospectus of funds you own and check to see if there are comparable options that cost less.

- [READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sph67r/trying_to_understand_the_math_of_mutual_fund_fees/) before considering a managed account or any other with high fees.
	- The same calculation can be ran for any investment value, period, and rate of return to match your scenario.
		- The formula for compound growth is **FV = P * ( 1 + r /n )^nt**
			- (FV) is the future value (principal + interest)
			- (P) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
			- (r) is the annual interest rate (decimal)
			- (n) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year
			- (t) is the time the money is invested for in years.
	- Here's a [compound growth calculator that accounts for the expense ratio](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/expense-ratio#how-much-does-the-expense-ratio-cost-you) and returns the maturity value and shows the total fees paid over the life of an investment. The [inflation adjusted rate of return](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/real-rate-of-return) can be calculated using an [inflation rate](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp) of your choice and plugged into the growth calculator for a more accurate estimate of future buying power. 

- Page 115 (PDF page 142) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) gives an example of how easily unnecessary costs can get out of hand. It is amazing how some of the best long-term investing options are offered for such a low cost, while other products offered by the same investment company can cost tens of times the amount! 
- See also [What Is a Good Expense Ratio for Mutual Funds?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/when-expense-ratio-considered-high-and-when-it-considered-low.asp) from Investopedia to compare what is currently considered an acceptable expense ratio, and then see if you can do better.
- When investing in multiple funds the costs associated with a particular fund only apply to the money invested in that fund. Therefore the effective cost, i.e. weighted average expense, of owning multiple funds must be calculated similar to calculating an effective tax rate.
	- **Weighted average expense = Total expense / Total investments * 100%**
- The expense ratio deduction will never appear on a statement or anywhere else. It is pulled from the net asset value (NAV) of the entire fund for each investor on a daily basis.
	- Daily expense ratio = Expense ratio / Number of days the market is open (~252)
	- Funds report earnings with the expense ratio factored in, e.g., a fund with an expense ratio of 0.04% and reported average earnings of 9.78% had actual average earnings of 9.82%.
- For investors considering a fund of funds <!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> with a target retirement date, **a 0.2%-0.5% expense ratio** is considered acceptable per the Bogleheads', which **can be considered a maximum for any portfolio's total management cost**. For comparison, check out the current expense ratio of Vanguard's Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares [mutual fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtwax) (VTWAX), and the [ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) version. Assess the convenience cost of TDF automatic rebalancing and if it is worth it to you in the end. Funds of funds are required to report line item *acquired fund fees and expenses* in their prospectus to differentiate the management fees inherited from the included funds. 
- In 2018, Fidelity was the first brokerage to offer no-cost index fund investing with no minimum investment. No catches, except that the funds are proprietary and cannot be transferred to another broker. Funds must be sold before moving to a new broker. Selling carries a tax bill if held in a taxable brokerage account, but a cash out transfer from tax-advantaged to qualified tax-advantaged account is tax free when completed within the 60-day window. Other fund managers may follow this zero-cost trend for certain funds, but investors should look at the long-term performance first and then consider the cost of ownership. Very low expense ratios do not amount to much cost over time relative to account balance.
## Manage Efficiently
Review the summarized list of portfolio characteristics and investing tips below. Criteria may or may not apply to an investor's strategy and may apply at different periods throughout the life of an investor.

- Start investing as early as possible in life.
- Avoid timing the market and contribute earned income on a scheduled basis.
- Avoid managed accounts with high fees. Look for the lowest cost workplace plans and consider if rollover options after leaving a job.
- Consider lower fee alternatives to employer provided investment products when available.
- The value of a financial advisor is their expertise about the law and explaining the best options available to help you see how different scenarios can potential play out. If seeking professional help, look for a certified financial planner that offers their service for a flat fee or time-based price structure. This way the exchange for their time is of more equal value than paying an annual commission for your money to sit in an investment account that will likely be semi or fully automated for the average investor.
- Assuming that when comparing funds to invest in, each are equally diversified, the expense ratio is generally the #1 indicator of how well a fund will perform over time as long as there are no other transactions fees or hidden expenses.
- 401(k) plan details about fees and expenses are provided in Summary Plan Descriptions. Form 5500 does not show individual account expenses, but additional documents may be requested from an employer about how much they are paying.
	- Workplace retirement plans may not offer the lowest cost investing options, but they are usually still the best retirement account to max out first at least up to the employer match, if a generous employer match is offered. 
- Avoid tax drag. Generally accomplished through the use of tax-advantaged accounts. This can become more nuanced if an investor plans to retire early. An early retiree must understand early withdrawal rules and possibly utilize other sources of income until the non-penalty withdrawal age is reached.
	- Use tax-advantaged accounts. 401K, 403b, IRAs, etc. There many different options for workers and their spouse through company plans.
- Least tax-efficient funds<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> should go in tax-advantaged accounts, e.g., mutual funds, high-yield bonds, dividend focused funds. 
- Most tax-efficient funds in taxable account.
	- Use tax efficient index funds like ETFs or mutual funds with redemption fees.
	- Keep mutual fund [turnover](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021616/what-good-turnover-ratio-mutual-fund.asp) low. Try to buy funds with very low turnover to avoid taxable events. Turnover frequency needs to be over one year to take advantage of long-term capital gains.
	- Funds having the fewest dividend assets.
	- Low dividend yield funds.
	- Qualified dividends are more tax efficient than ordinary dividends.
	- [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/) lists distribution statistics of a fund under Performance -> Distributions:
		- Income = dividends/interest
		- S/T Cap Gain = short-term capital gain
		- L/T Cap Gain = long-term capital gain
		- Values are listed in dollars distributed from the NAV (including ETFs).
- The general hierarchy of tax efficiency of different assets is found on [page 140](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) of the The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing (PDF page 167).
- The prospectus of a potential investment product should be used to confirm the performance and expenses. The prospectus lists the average before and after tax returns for recent periods which can be used to calculate the tax cost ratio. Morningstar.com provides the tax cost ratio of funds for 3, 5, 10, and 15 year periods. Use the tax cost ratio in addition to the expense ratio to determine the primary cost of fund ownership in taxable accounts.      
- Use tax harvesting<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> in taxable accounts. Investors need to be familiar with the wash sale rule<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> and be careful that automatic investing in any of their accounts does not trigger a wash sale. According to a First Quadrant, LP study, the median portfolio advantage of tax-loss harvesting was about 27% unrealized<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> (14% realized<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->) over purely passive investing. However, these values were measured on a portfolio of at least 500 individually managed stocks and do not account for management fees. [Tax-loss harvesting](../taxes.md#tax-harvesting) is primarily for very high net worth individuals in special circumstances. If you have a few individually picked stocks here or there, or the opportunity to harvest index fund gains or losses it is also acceptable.
	- Use HIFO (highest in, first out accounting method), which is removing the assets that have shown the least returns or highest loss from an account. This is possible through specific identification of shares. Accounting cost basis settings can be changed for each brokerage account.
- Buy fund shares after the distribution date when held in a taxable account.
	- Capital gain distribution in funds works differently than individual equities and investors pay taxes as a result of fund manager selling shares. Therefore capital gain tax is owed while owning the fund. 
	- Capital gain distribution generally occurs annually near the end of the calendar year, and investors can unwittingly purchase a fund nearing the distribution date and find out they have to pay 
- Sell fund shares before the distribution date.
	- Selling the fund before the distribution date avoids having to pay tax on [turnover](../taxes.md#unrealized-capital-gains-losses)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> gains. Assuming the fund share price remains relatively the same after the distribution, the only tax will be that for the realized gain of the fund shares.
- If selling profitable shares near the year end, consider which year you want the gains tax to fall into.
- Regarding bonds, per the 2014 publishing of The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing, it is advised to use a bond advisor for certain bonds due to deceptive restricted clauses and hidden fees in certain bond types (e.g., corporate bonds). An exception would be using treasurydirect.com that offers direct issues of U.S. government bonds to end users.
	- Duration (period until maturity) should be <= time until a particular debt investment needs to be withdrawn, including bond funds.
		- Bond fund duration is generally 1-4 years (short), 4-10 years (intermediate), 10+ years (long).
	- Since bonds are relatively safe compared to equities, use high rate bonds, not the highest yield.
	- Fixed income securities subject to tax should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts if you have room for them since their ordinary tax rates are less tax efficient.
- Consider converting pre-tax retirement account funds to a Roth account during low income years.
- Be prepared to pass on assets by having legal instructions written up in a will or trust and named beneficiaries for retirement accounts. 
## Achieve Your Goals
- Write down your goals.
	- Follow an [investment policy statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement), and/or
	- Use the [SMART](https://www.google.com/search?q=smart+goals+method+explained&sca_esv=c137534a6bb4ed6f&source=hp&ei=HduNZ4ipCbi40PEPxqOp8Qo&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZ43pLb20yEAO4WglfMQnj33xdHaUpHX1&ved=0ahUKEwjIq6blxIOLAxU4HDQIHcZRKq4Q4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=smart+goals+method+explained&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IhxzbWFydCBnb2FscyBtZXRob2QgZXhwbGFpbmVkMgYQABgWGB4yCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBTIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIESIQBUABYAHAAeACQAQCYAV-gAV-qAQExuAEDyAEA-AEC-AEBmAIBoAJlmAMAkgcDMC4xoAf2Aw&sclient=gws-wiz) method for goals.

	- Check progress annually using a [net worth calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/net-worth-calculator).
		- A spreadsheet file or app is preferred to an online calculator as it allows you to measure your progress easier. Integrated budgeting apps such as Mint, Empower (formerly Personal Capital), or [alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=alternatives+to+mint+for+net+worth+tracking&cId=bfe2e1f7-be67-4d14-b3e6-e063bb036759&iId=14ed36eb-a5a6-4997-b116-d8bb1e387ef0) add this and many more conveniences.

- Track cash flow by creating and following a budget/spending plan.
- Do not make a spending plan so strict that it cuts out all luxuries. Instead use low cost luxuries.
- Along with cost efficient luxuries, reward yourself with a small reward when milestones are met.
- Share your goals with someone who will keep you accountable.
