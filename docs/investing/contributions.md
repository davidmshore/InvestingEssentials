## To Personal Accounts

## Contributing to Another Person's Account
 [How to Make an IRA Contribution as a Gift](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-make-an-ira-contribution-as-a-gift-5205157) (investopedia.com)
 
 - The basic rules:
	 - Only children and spouses can be recipients of direct IRA contributions.
	 - Total contributions to a spouse's account are capped at the lower of:
		 - The contributing spouse's earned income for the year, or
		 - The maximum allowed contribution for the IRA.
	 - Total contributions to a child's account are capped at what the accountholder (child) has earned for the year or the maximum contribution for the IRA.
		 - For example, a child who earns $1000 reported income over the summer is eligible to receive a total of $1000 in contributions to their IRA account and is not required to invest any of their own earned income. The key here is earned income amount reported on a tax return (wages, self-employment income, etc.); investment income (e.g., stock dividends or interest) does not count.
	 - The child or spouse can make direct contributions of money gifted to them from individuals other than a parent or spouse per the previously mentioned rules and limits.
## Custodial Accounts for Minors
 Regarding children, there are multiple investment [options](https://www.moneycrashers.com/financial-accounts-open-child/) that parents/guardians may want to consider for their child before an IRA, such as a 529, UGMA, or UTMA. Still, considering there are currently no direct rollovers from these accounts to retirement accounts without taxes or penalties, opening a custodial retirement account for a child and teaching them the concepts of compounding may encourage investing habits and provide a great start for retirement.

| **UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act)**        | A custodial account that allows gifts of money, securities, and other assets to be made to a minor. The custodian manages the account until the minor reaches adulthood.                            | Transfers would generally be treated as a sale of assets, so capital gains tax could apply if the assets have appreciated. Any gains realized upon liquidation of the assets may be taxed as the child’s income.                 | If assets are liquidated before transfer, transaction fees may apply (e.g., brokerage fees for selling assets). However, there are typically no fees for in-kind transfers.                              |
| **UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)**    | Similar to UGMA, but broader in scope, allowing more types of assets to be transferred, including real estate and patents.                                                                          | Similar to UGMA, transferring assets to a retirement account typically involves a sale of the assets, triggering capital gains tax on any gains realized. Short-term or long-term capital gains tax may apply.                   | Similar to UGMA, fees would apply if assets are liquidated and sold before transferring to the retirement account, with possible account closure fees if moving assets out of the custodial institution. |
| **529 College Savings Plan**                  | A tax-advantaged savings plan specifically for education expenses. It allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals when used for qualified education expenses.                                        | Funds cannot be directly transferred to a retirement account. Withdrawals for non-education purposes are subject to ordinary income tax on the earnings, plus a 10% penalty.                                                     | Typically no fees for transferring between 529 accounts. However, withdrawing funds may involve transaction fees or fees for closing the account if moving funds to a non-educational account.           |
| **Coverdell ESA (Education Savings Account)** | A tax-advantaged account similar to the 529 plan, but with a lower contribution limit. It can be used for education-related expenses for students under 30 years old.                               | Similar to 529 plans, funds cannot be transferred directly to a retirement account. Withdrawals for non-education purposes will be taxed as ordinary income and subject to a 10% penalty on earnings.                            | Fees for transferring assets between Coverdell ESA accounts are generally minimal, but liquidation of assets to move to a non-retirement account may incur transaction fees.                             |
| **Custodial Brokerage Account**               | A taxable brokerage account managed by an adult on behalf of a minor, where the minor owns the investments when they reach adulthood.                                                               | If assets are liquidated to fund a retirement account, capital gains tax is triggered on any realized gains. Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate.                     | Liquidation of assets often involves transaction costs such as commissions or fees. Fees can also apply if assets are transferred out of the brokerage account or if the account is closed.              |
| **Custodial Trust Accounts**                  | A trust set up for a minor, where the custodian manages the assets until the minor reaches adulthood. The trust can hold various types of assets and can be more flexible than a custodial account. | Similar to a brokerage account, liquidating the trust’s assets may trigger capital gains tax on any realized gains. The tax treatment depends on the type of trust, but generally, income generated within the trust is taxable. | Fees for transferring assets from a custodial trust may include transaction costs for asset liquidation, as well as legal or administrative fees, depending on the trust’s terms.                        |
