## Deadlines
- Contributions for certain accounts are allowed from January 1st of the tax year until the tax filing date the following year, with the option to designate contributions made the following year toward the tax year of choice (its almost always better to have them go toward the earlier year). The extra time is allowed in part because income-based contribution limitations may not be known until year end.
- Roth [conversions](../accounts/rollovers-conversions.md)<!-- #internal_link --> are taxed as ordinary income for the tax year in which they are converted.
## Income
- HSAs may be funded with any income. Earned income is not required.
- Workplace retirement plans may be funded with payroll deductions.
- IRA contributions can be made with certain taxable income received during the tax year.
	- Payroll income
	- Self-employment income
	- Alimony (for separations finalized before 2019)
	- Non-taxable combat pay (W2 box 12)
	- Education benefits if reported in (W2 box 1) or benefits reported on a 1099.
	- Roth conversions are the one exception where contribution to an IRA does not require earned income, nor does it have a limit on how much can be converted. Terms such as backdoor Roth, mega-backdoor Roth, and Roth conversion ladder all refer to converting pre-tax retirement account funds to a Roth account. Income tax is due in the year funds are converted. Unlike direct IRA contributions, the cutoff for conversion is December 31st.
- Income may limit the accounts that may be contributed to or the amount of contribution that my be deducted. See [comparison tables](../accounts/types.md)<!-- #internal_link --> of account types and the [summary tables](../accounts/contribution-and-deductibility-summaries.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for a summarized list of all categorical account types and deduction rules.
- Income eligible limitations are determined by income earned during the calendar year.
- Investments in taxable brokerage accounts can be made with any income.
## Matching
- Always check employer matching with workplace retirement accounts.
	- An [employer matching maximizer calculator](../resources/tools.md#401k-maximizer-calculator)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> is included in Resources.
- Since 2023, some investment firms began offering IRA matching for holding an account with their company, e.g. 1% matching. Caveats include meeting a certain account value and/or a minimum holding period.
- Some companies may offer a bonus for opening a new account.
- Matches do not count toward an annual contribution limit, but it does count as interest.
## To Personal Accounts
- See [comparison tables](../accounts/types.md)<!-- #internal_link --> of account types and the [summary tables](../accounts/contribution-and-deductibility-summaries.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for a summarized list of all categorical account types, deduction rules, and cutoff dates.
## Contributing to Another Person's Account

 - Only a child or spouse can be recipients of direct IRA contributions.
 - Total contributions to a spouse's account are capped at the lower of:
	 - The contributing spouse's earned income for the year, or
	 - The maximum allowed contribution for the IRA.
 - Total contributions to a child's account are capped at what the accountholder (child) has earned for the year or the maximum contribution for the IRA.
	 - For example, a child who earns $1000 reported income is eligible to receive a total of $1000 in contributions to their IRA account and is not required to invest any of their own earned income. The key here is the earned income amount reported on a tax return (wages, self-employment income, etc.); investment income (e.g., stock dividends or interest) does not count.

 - A child or spouse can make direct contributions of money gifted to them from individuals other than a parent or spouse per the previously mentioned rules and limits.
