## Deadlines
- Contributions to IRAs are allowed from January 1st of the tax year until the tax filing date in the following year. The IRS also gives the option to designate contributions made the following year toward the tax year of choice. The extra time is allowed in part because income based contribution limitations may not be known until year end. Workplace retirement plans are not subject to income limitations so contribution deadlines are December 31st.
- Roth [conversions](../accounts/rollovers-conversions.md)<!-- #internal_link --> are taxed as ordinary income for the tax year in which they are converted.
## Income
- Taxable brokerage accounts may be funded with any income. Earned income is not required.
- HSAs may be funded with any income. Earned income is not required.
- Workplace retirement plans may be funded with payroll deductions.
- IRA contributions can be made with certain taxable income received during the tax year.
	- Payroll income
	- Self-employment income
	- Alimony (for separations finalized on or before December 31st, 2018)
	- Non-taxable combat pay (W2 box 12)
	- Education benefits if reported in (W2 box 1) or benefits reported on a 1099.
	- Rollovers/conversions are the one exception where contributing to a retirement plan does not require earned income, nor does it have a limit on how much can be converted. Terms such as backdoor Roth, mega-backdoor Roth, and Roth conversion ladder all refer to converting pre-tax retirement account funds to a Roth account. Income tax is due in the year funds are converted. Unlike the deadline for direct IRA contributions, the tax year in which the conversion is completed is the year that converted funds will be taxed.
- Income level can affect Roth IRA contributions and the deductibility of traditional IRA contributions. See [comparison tables](../accounts/types.md)<!-- #internal_link --> of account types and the [summary tables](../accounts/contribution-and-deductibility-summaries.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for a summarized list of all categorical account types and deduction rules.
- Income eligible limitations are determined by income earned during the calendar year.
## Matching
- Always check employer matching with workplace retirement accounts.
	- An [employer matching maximizer calculator](../resources/tools.md#401k-maximizer-calculator)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> is included in Resources.
- Since 2023, some investment firms began offering IRA matching for holding an account with their company, e.g. 1% matching. Caveats include meeting a certain account value and/or a minimum holding period.
- Some companies may offer a bonus for opening a new account.
- Matches do not count toward an annual contribution limit, but it does count as interest.
## To Personal Accounts
- See [comparison tables](../accounts/types.md)<!-- #internal_link --> of account types and the [summary tables](../accounts/contribution-and-deductibility-summaries.md)<!-- #internal_link --> for a summarized list of all categorical account types, deduction rules, and cutoff dates.
## Contributing to Another Person's Account
 [How to Make an IRA Contribution as a Gift](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-make-an-ira-contribution-as-a-gift-5205157) (investopedia.com)
 
 - An IRA is always opened in the name of the future retiree.
 - Spousal contributions require joint tax filing.
	 - Total contributions to a spouse's account are capped at the lower of:
		 - The contributing spouse's earned income for the year, or
		 - The maximum allowed contribution for the IRA.
	 - To max out both spouse's IRAs, their combined earned income must be greater than or equal to 2x the annual IRA maximum contribution limit.
 - Total contributions to a child's account are capped at what the accountholder (child) has earned for the year or the maximum contribution for the IRA.
 - A child or spouse can make direct contributions of money gifted to them as long as the previously mentioned rules and earned income limits are met.
	 - For example, a child who earns $1000 of reported income is eligible to contribute a total of $1000 into their IRA. Generous family and friends decide to help the child get started with retirement planning by gifting a combined total of $600. The child decides to invest $400 of their earned income and the $600 gift, maxing out their allowed contribution. The key here is the earned income amount reported on a tax return (wages, self-employment income, etc.); investment income (e.g., stock dividends or interest) does not count.

 - Changes to 529 rules now allow rollover of a portion of unused funds to a Roth IRA.
