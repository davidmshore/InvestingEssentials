## The Simple Portfolio
- A portfolio refers to all of the investments that an investor has put their money into.
- To stick with the overall idea of keeping things simple, diversification is the simplest way to ensure steady growth and remain balanced during market declines (i.e. experience an average drawdown, not cancel out the effects of a decline in the overall market).
- Many investors focused on growing their retirement investments opt for the simplest options, such as target date funds (TDFs), or one of the Bogleheads' [lazy portfolios](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios) which definitely make getting started easier. Both are far superior options than waiting to start and can be modified at any point with tax consideration depending on the account type. This simplified answer to a Redditor on [Boglehead thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/12623ff/comment/je79z9v/) may help wrap up your understanding. 
	- The main considerations with a target date fund are whether the fees are low enough to justify letting it run its course, if the investor is okay with the path that the portfolio will take, and whether an investor is disciplined enough to periodically rebalance their portfolio. When the fees are low enough and a diversified fund looks like it should perform well, then [TDFs are acceptable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1er9lrb/should_one_even_bother_with_targetdate_allinone/), but understand that they are simply predetermined rebalancing plans. They may not perform as well as an informed investor taking a more active role in allocating their portfolio. Most of the time your money will sit in an investment account and need only be managed once a year. An investor can always look at the glide path of a TDF and follow it in a manually managed account. For investors starting later in life who opt to use a TDF, choosing a later target date is one option to allocate more of the fund toward aggressive growth in equities. The fund can be changed again in the future, just make sure to add up all the fees.
- The rule of 110 is the basis for a simple allocation strategy that states that 110 minus a person's age is the percentage of portfolio capital that should be invested in equities.
	- The logic of the rule is that equities provide the best opportunity for a portfolio to grow, especially when an investor is young and has time to allow for market fluctuations, while gradually reducing the amount of capital invested in stocks ensures that an adequate portion of the gains are safer against recession getting closer to and throughout retirement.
	- It is common to have 5% of one's portfolio in cash using this method, with the remainder in bonds after the equity allocation when using this rule. For young, healthy investors with an emergency fund and short term savings goals covered, it may be okay to skip the portfolio cash reserve to focus as much capital on growth as early on as possible.

- Chapter 8 of the [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) goes into more detail about sub-allocating the primary investment groups: equities, debt and cash as well as fund suggestions based on age. The link above is to the first edition of the book and while there is an updated version from 2014, the concepts are the same.
- Whatever your allocation may be, maximizing diversified growth is most easily achieved through low-cost index fund investing.
## Considerations
- Risk
	- Risk can generally be mitigated the longer the investment period is.
- Liquidity
	- How long can the money be invested without needing access to it and what will be the tax bill for withdrawing it?
- Return
	- The after-tax rate of return.
	- The **after tax rate of return = pre-tax rate of return x (1 - the effective tax rate [sum of state and federal tax rates])** 
- Taxable or tax advantaged account?
	- Tax efficient assets (e.g., qualified dividends) should go in taxable accounts and inefficient assets (e.g., ordinary dividends and bonds) should go in tax advantaged accounts.
- Details regarding an investment may be found in the asset's [prospectus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp), which is the most reliable source of information about potential investments. Workplace retirement plans should have a Summary Plan Description (SPD) that tells an employee what fees and expenses are charged and if it is up to the employee or employer to pay them. There are additional documents that an employee may request detailing how an employer is paying fees and expenses.
## Equities (Stocks)
- While the rule of 110 is very easy to maintain, investors starting later in life may want to consider the risk-to-reward of investing more in equities, such as how many more years could the investor continue working if the market were to crash nearing retirement.
#### Equities Subdivision
- <=10% sector focused
	- It is generally better not to be focused on a specific market sector, e.g., energy, unless the investor has a good reason.
- <=10% REIT
	- Real estate investment trusts are real estate securities that offer returns on rental property to investors.
- <=20% global equities
	- Global investment is okay to have or not giving consideration to the stability of the domestic economy. For US investors, it can help smooth out periods of poor US stock market performance, but it has historically slightly underperformed the US market on average.
	- Large cap domestic companies doing business globally are, in a way, a global investment.
- These values may be adjusted. Overall, keep approximately 80% of the equities allocation in US equities. 100% equities has been historically acceptable for individuals 2+ decades from retirement, using a modified the rule of 110.
## Debt
- Duration (period until maturity) should be <= time until investment withdrawals. 
- REITs can also be interest earning securities in the form of mortgage backed securities or a combination of equity and debt investment in one security.
- As with any debt investment, look for high yield returns.
## Indices
- For index investing, a fund of funds with a target retirement date can be a good choice if fees can be kept low, i.e. per the Bogleheads' this was 0.2%-0.5% and no more, including taking into account any extra fees for the convenience of automatic rebalancing. However, if a similar portfolio can be created with a lower overall expense an investor will have slightly more retirement income. For example the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX) has an expense ratio of just 0.04%. Other passively managed funds should have comparably low expense ratios, and fund of funds may be chosen apart from TDF management. So, assess the convenience cost of automatic rebalancing and if it is worth it to you in the end. This calculation will be covered in the next section. 
- The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing references the [Wilshire 5000](https://www.wilshireindexes.com/products/ft-wilshire-5000-index-series) as a US benchmark that other indices are measured against and is worth considering as the bulk investment asset for equity allocation.
- An important fact for investors to know is that [passive funds have historically outperformed actively managed funds](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=278454). 
## Rebalancing
- Rebalancing refers to the reassignment of how much money is staked into each of the asset categories in a portfolio.
- The five main factors when considering rebalancing a portfolio are imbalances due to large gains or losses in certain assets, improper allocation of contributions made throughout the year, age, taxes and fees. It is recommended to review chapters 8 and 17 of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) annually and then see how your allocations compare to your target.
	- Review your goals before the year end if any reallocation of taxable brokerage accounts may be needed.
- A robo-advisor can make these decisions for an investor if the fees are acceptable.
