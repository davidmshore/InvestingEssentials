- A broker is a middle man between a securities exchange—where financial assets are bought and sold—and an investor.
- The main investment brokerage firms are [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/), and [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/) and each will generally have the lowest index fund expense ratios.
- Which assets an investor chooses to put the majority of their capital into will determine which broker to use. The average investor will have comparable options or comparable combinations of options from any of the brokers, with some broker specific funds available for purchase through other brokers.
	- An investor can use more than one broker, but know that annual tax reporting will be required for interest, dividends and capital gains, and depending on the number of transactions that occur in a year, having this information from one broker can simplify things. This is reported on a 1099. Some brokers might go further and consolidate multiple accounts held at the firm into a single document called a consolidated 1099. Most paid tax software can simplify or automate the process via importing 1099 documents and spreadsheets can handle whatever your needs may be with a little effort.
- Setting up an account is straightforward and free.
