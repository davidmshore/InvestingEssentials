- A broker is a middle man between a securities exchange—where the majority of financial products are bought and sold—and an investor.
- The largest investment brokerage firms in the United States are [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/), and [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/), and each will generally have the lowest cost investment options.
- Which products an investor chooses to invest their cash into will determine which broker to use. Some products will be specific to certain brokers, such as certain funds, and the fees for purchasing certain products may vary. The average investor will have comparable options from any of the brokers. Broker specific funds may be available for purchase through other brokers too. Technology and competition has reduced overhead and pushed minimums so low that funding accounts requires as little as $1 to get started. Additionally, investors have the option to purchase non-broker funds directly from fund management companies.
- You can have accounts with more than one broker or asset management company, but know that annual tax reporting will be required for distributions of interest, dividends and capital gains. This is reported on a 1099. Depending on the number of payments or transactions you have in a year, having this information from one broker can simplify things. Most tax preparation software can simplify or automate basic tax reporting needs via importing 1099 documents. If you are comfortable with spreadsheets, building your own can handle whatever your needs may be with a little effort as well.
- Setting up a brokerage account is straightforward and free.
