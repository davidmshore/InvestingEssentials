## Annuities
- Annuities are contracts between an individual and an insurance company or charity, where the individual pays into the annuity in installments or a lump sum, and receives periodic payments for a set period.
- Annuities fall into three categories: fixed, variable and immediate.
- While there are some similarities to tax advantaged accounts such as tax deferred growth, annuities are generally not considered a good investment, because the insurance company is probably making better returns on the investment money in exchange for a *guaranteed* payment. Note that fixed and immediate annuities rely on the financial stability of the insurance company. Annuities are usually only worth considering later in life when there is little time or money to be invested in compounding assets. However, investors should look at the overall return while keeping in mind how much of a tax advantage an annuity may provide, if any, compared to other tax advantaged accounts, especially if the annuity return rate changes throughout the contract period.
- Another negative for annuities is whether it includes an inflation rider. If not, then the investor runs the risk of the set value of periodic payments becoming devalued and if it does, expect a higher cost annuity.
- An annuity as a tax advantaged gifting mechanism may be worth considering if maximizing a gift rather than maximizing retirement income is the goal.

## Interest Earning Investments
- Interest earning investments are debt investments, i.e. the investor is agreeing to lend money in return for an interest payment.
- Interest is taxed as ordinary income unless exempt, e.g., with certain types of bonds.
### Savings Account
- [Savings accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/savings-accounts-4689728) should definitely not be an investment option for retirement planning, but there are cases when near-future spending expectations may make a FDIC or NCUA insured [high-yield savings account](https://www.ourfirstfed.com/support/financial-education/basics-of-high-yield-savings-accounts) (HYSA) a good choice. Some examples are an upcoming vacation or automobile purchase. Calculating the difference between an HYSA's expected return versus comparably liquid options will help determine what the right choice will be. Remember to use the correct tax rates when comparing—savings interest is taxed as ordinary income, whereas capital gains are taxed at short or long term rates depending on the holding period.
- Review withdrawal and interest rules about the particular HYSA before opening an account, e.g., the number of allowed withdrawals per month without penalty.
- Online-only banks generally offer better rates than traditional banks.
### Certificate of Deposit (CD)
- The rate of return is usually comparable or better than an HYSA, but the ability to withdraw the money is more restrictive. Returns are also taxed as ordinary income, so the comparison to HYSAs is easy to make. Again, not a high enough return retirement planning option.
### Bonds
- [Bond investment](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0312/the-basics-of-bonds.aspx) can be thought of similar to CDs, because the investment is generally long term and interest is taxed at ordinary income rates, but **bonds offer better tax advantages depending on the type of bond and certain bond types can be sold on the bond market.**
- After the initial issue of a bond to an investor, **bonds that can be traded on the secondary market can result in a capital gain or capital loss**. The value of the bond increases or decreases based on supply and demand of a bond's perceived value similar to buying and selling stock.
- Therefore, **the actual return on a bond takes into consideration the yield rate** (the interest paid to the investor) **and capital gain or loss if the investor chooses to sell the bond before its maturity date** (the date when the bond stops paying interest) . Remember that ordinary income and capital gains are taxed at different rates when calculating an overall return. The periodic monetary interest payment to a bond owner is known as the coupon payment. Payment periods are generally annual, semi-annual, or quarterly.
- Debt issued by the government goes by different names depending on the type and term lengths.
	- EE Bonds are a low-risk, long-term savings option with a fixed interest rate, guaranteed doubling after 20 years, and some tax advantages. They are designed to encourage saving for the future, but generally offer the lowest rate of return.
	- I-bonds are a type of US government savings bond designed to prevent devaluation caused by inflation. There are two rates that determine the interest rate of an I-bond: a fixed rate and a variable inflation rate. The variable rate is updated based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) every May and November. Interest payment for I-bonds is unique, because it is payed to the bondholder when the bond is redeemed through the US Treasury Department. This means the interest compounds tax deferred over the holding period. I-bonds have a 30 year maturity, but they can be redeemed after 1 year. If sold before 5 years, the last 3 months of interest is sacrificed.

	- [U.S. Bonds vs. Bills vs. Notes: What's the Difference?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-bills-notes-and-bonds/) (investopedia.com)
		- Treasury Bills (T-Bills): No periodic interest payments; bills are sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity in 1 year or less.
		- Treasury Notes (T-Notes) pay semiannual interest every 6 months, with maturities between 2 to 10 years.
		- Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds) also pay semiannual interest every 6 months, with maturities of 10 to 30 years.
- U.S. Savings Bonds are non-transferable, meaning they cannot be traded on the bond market, but they can be passed on through inheritance. The two types are:
	- EE Bonds
	- I-Bonds
	- Both offer educational expense tax advantages as well as tax deferral or current year interest reporting for EE bonds held by low or no income individuals, such as minors.
- Bonds are rated prior to issuing for sale to the public and ratings can change over the life of the bond. Higher yielding bonds generally receive a higher risk rating, and are commonly referred to as *junk* bonds.
	- Corporate bonds carry higher risk than government bonds (assuming the government and national currency is stable).

- Call Risk refers to the possibility that a bond issuer may redeem, or call, the bond before its maturity date, typically when interest rates decline (and the bond issuer does not want to continue paying the higher interest rate). This can result in investors losing out on future interest payments and having to reinvest the principal at lower rates. Callable bonds, such as many corporate and municipal bonds, may offer higher yields to compensate for this risk. U.S. Treasury Bonds and most savings bonds are generally not susceptible to early redemption. Callable bonds often include a yield-to-call (YTC) calculation, which helps investors assess potential returns if the bond is called early.
- **Bond investing is generally the most secure way to maintain a certain percentage of portfolio gains while continuing to maximize gains at a tolerable risk-to-reward ratio when approaching, and throughout retirement.**
- Investors should be aware of how certain bond interest is affected by other sources of income such as Social Security, as in the case of [municipal bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing-strategy/090116/think-twice-buying-taxfree-municipal-bonds.asp). See [Taxes -> Bonds](../taxes.md#bonds)<!-- #internal_link --> for a summary of bond taxation rules.
- Bonds are an annual tax consideration when held in taxable accounts.
### Key Differences Between Early Withdrawal from a CD vs. Selling a Bond Early

| **Factor**              | **CD Early Withdrawal**                                                                                                                                                                               | **Bond Sale Before Maturity**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Penalty/Cost**        | Early withdrawal usually results in a **penalty**. The penalty is typically the **forfeiture of interest** earned, and in some cases, even part of the principal (especially for long-term CDs, though this is rare).      | When selling a bond early, there is no **fixed penalty**. Instead, the bond may be sold for more or less than the purchase price, resulting in a **capital gain** or **capital loss**, depending on market conditions.                                                |
| **Effect on Principal** | In most cases, **the principal is not at risk**, but the **interest earned could be forfeited**, and in some rare cases (like long-term CDs), part of the principal might be taken as part of the penalty. | The **principal can fluctuate**, depending on whether the bond is sold at a premium (above par value) or at a discount (below par value). You could receive more or less than your original investment based on interest rates and market conditions.                 |
| **Liquidity**           | **Low liquidity** because the CD is locked in for the term of the investment. Early withdrawal is subject to penalties, and not all banks may allow for early withdrawal without penalty.             | **High liquidity** because bonds can be sold at any time in the secondary market. However, the market price will depend on factors such as interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer.                                                                     |
| **Market Impact**       | There is **no market risk** with a CD since the interest rate and penalty are fixed by the bank. The penalty is pre-defined.                                                                          | The market price of a bond **fluctuates** based on factors like **interest rates** and the bond’s **credit risk**. If rates rise or the bond issuer’s credit deteriorates, the bond’s price could drop, leading to a potential loss when sold early.                  |
| **Taxes**               | **Interest** earned on a CD is taxed as **ordinary income**. Early withdrawal does not affect the tax treatment, except for the forfeiture of interest, which would reduce the taxable amount.        | Interest from a bond is taxed as **ordinary income**. However, if the bond is sold for a **capital gain**, that gain will be taxed either as **short-term** or **long-term** capital gains, depending on how long the bond was held. Capital losses can offset gains. Also, note that municipal bond interest is often exempt from federal taxes, and sometimes state and local taxes. |

## Equities
- Shares of ownership of a publicly traded company, i.e. public stocks. Stock gains are taxed at capital gains rates, and losses may be deducted up to a certain amount each year with carryover allowed into future tax years. Some equities pay dividends, i.e., company profits shared with shareholders while an investor owns the stock. Investors can direct their broker to automatically reinvest dividends by purchasing additional shares. Like bonds, dividend paying stocks are a tax consideration when held in a taxable account. 
- **Equities are the best financial market asset for growing an investment portfolio** and are also susceptible to the largest declines during economic downturns. 
## Commodities
- Investments in physical goods, such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. Contracts based on an agreed upon price at a future delivery date are bought and sold on the futures market. A contract may be sold before the actual delivery of goods. Commodities are **not advised** for individual investors, especially for the casual investor or someone focused on their retirement account. 
## Index Funds
- A type of ETF or mutual fund that tracks a specific market index, i.e. a predetermined set of assets such as the S&P 500, to provide broad market exposure and diversification, which reduces risk. Fund managers are responsible for building the fund to contain the proper securities and in similar proportions to an index. Index fund management is synonymous with passive management and index fund investing is known as passive investing. **Index funds are the primary investment vehicle** a retirement investor should be looking into for a high return on investment at a relatively low risk over a long term period. 
## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
- ETFs can track indices, aka indexes, which allow you to invest in shares of a broad set of assets, e.g. equities or bonds or a combination (i.e. hybrid/balanced funds). ETFs are available for a variety of asset types with varying levels of diversification. ETFs can be actively or passively managed, meaning they can be filled with assets specially chosen by the manager, or setup to follow an index. 
- ETFs are unique in their turnover, i.e. the selling and repurchasing of equities within the fund by managers, aka custodians, as they seek to allocate the fund holdings to meet the desired goals, e.g., tracking an index. ETF turnover is done with *in-kind* redemption meaning that shares are effectively exchanged for new shares without the intermediary step of holding cash from the sale until different shares are repurchased. Therefore, ETF turnover does not trigger a taxable event in the form of a typical capital gain or loss for shareholders.
- A simple way to remember the tax advantage of ETFs is to compare turnover to a mutual fund that holds the exact same shares:
	- Mutual fund turnover will result in capital gains distributions (income for a shareholder) and be subject to capital gains tax for that year.
	- ETF turnover defers capital gains distributions until the shareholder sells their shares.
	- Holding ETFs in a tax deferred account does not offer any additional tax benefit over the mutual fund. 
- Dividends and interest payments are still subject to tax for the year they are paid out when an ETF is held in a taxable brokerage account.
- Some ETFs may be proprietary to a specific broker, but these can often still be purchased on an exchange through other brokers commission free. In the case of moving funds from an account held at one broker to an account held at another broker, although ETFs are treated in-kind, always check for broker fees.
## Mutual Funds
- Similar to ETFs, mutual funds can be actively or passively managed. The turnover rate may be similar to active and passive ETFs, but turnover in mutual funds generally triggers a taxable event, which can lead to tax drag when held in a taxable brokerage account. Interest and dividends from assets held in taxable accounts are taxed the same as for ETFs.
- Some mutual funds may be proprietary to the broker, but these can often be purchased through other brokers as well. Pay attention for higher transaction fees when purchasing funds this way or when moving funds from one broker to another. 
- The simplest way to think about the differences between mutual funds and ETFs is that ETFs trade like stocks and they have the in-kind transfer advantage, while mutual funds have the advantage of fractional share purchases, which can make automatic investing easier. Direct fractional share ETF investing or reinvesting of dividends is currently possible through some brokers and will likely become the standard.

## Fund Ratings
- MorningStar, who is considered one of the most reputable financial services companies for ranking past mutual fund performance, states that *past performance does not indicate future performance and should not be used to choose a fund*. Past performance of a specific fund other than broad market funds should never be used as the primary reason to pick one.

	>In 2014, _The Wall Street Journal_ requested that Morningstar produce a comprehensive list of five-star funds over 10 years starting in 2004. The publication discovered that 37% of funds lost one star, 31% lost two stars, 14% lost three stars, and 3% dropped down to one star. Only 14%, or 58 out of 403, retained their premium ratings.
	>
	>To express it a different way, investors invest money in a five-star mutual fund in the hopes of achieving five-star results moving forward, yet only 14% of such funds proved worthy of those hopes. If an investor was willing to accept a four- or five-star performance, the results were more palatable, since 51% of Morningstar's five-star funds in 2004 received a four-star or above rating in 2014.2
