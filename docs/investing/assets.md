## Annuities
- Annuities are *contracts* between an individual and an insurance company or charity, where the annuity owner pays into the annuity in installments or a lump sum in exchange for periodic payments for a set period. Annuities are insurance products, not investments, even though an annuity may be linked to investments products like stocks or bonds. A unique feature of annuities, and one of their primary appeals, is that the agreement generally lasts for the life of the [annuitant](https://www.annuity.org/annuities/annuitant/) (recipient), similar to some pension plans or social security.
- Annuities fall into [four primary categories](https://www.thrivent.com/insights/annuities/the-4-types-of-annuities-which-is-right-for-you): fixed, variable, immediate, and deferred.
- While there are some similarities to tax advantaged accounts such as tax deferred growth, annuities are generally not considered a good investment. For the insurance company to profit it must make better returns on the investment money in exchange for guaranteed payments. Note that fixed and immediate annuities rely on the financial stability of the insurance company. Annuities are a consideration for later in life when investments will begin to be drawn down rather than built up, there is less time for compounding and lower risk tolerance. As the years go on investors should look closer at how annuities work and the overall return while keeping in mind how much of a tax advantage an annuity may provide, if any, compared to other tax advantaged accounts and low risk asset options like bonds. 
- An annuity as a tax advantaged gifting mechanism may be worth considering if maximizing a gift rather than maximizing retirement income is the goal.
- Before signing up for an annuity it is advised to meet with a professional, fee-only, financial advisor acting as a fiduciary for their clients to make sure the details are fully understood. Annuities often sound better than they are. Considerations should include the variability of payout, term length, beneficiary allowance, an inflation rider, cancellation penalties, the long term financial health of the insurer, and how much money should be put toward purchasing an annuity. A combination of social security and annuity income can provide emotional relief for retired individuals not wanting to wonder if they might outlive their retirement savings.

## Interest Earning Investments
- Interest earning investments are debt investments, i.e. the investor is agreeing to lend money in return for an interest payment.
- Interest is taxed as ordinary income unless exempt, e.g., with certain types of bonds.
### Savings Account
- [Savings accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/savings-accounts-4689728) should definitely not be an investment option for retirement planning, but there are cases when near-future spending expectations may make a FDIC or NCUA insured [high-yield savings account](https://www.ourfirstfed.com/support/financial-education/basics-of-high-yield-savings-accounts) (HYSA) a good choice. Near future generally means within 3 years where investing the money in the market is considered too risky and the timeline for investing in other long term assets will not provide a great enough return. Some examples are an upcoming vacation or automobile purchase. Calculating the difference between an HYSA's expected return versus comparably liquid <!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> options will help determine what the right choice will be. Remember to use the correct tax rates when comparing—savings interest is taxed as ordinary income, whereas capital gains are taxed at short or long term rates depending on the holding period.
- Review the details before opening a particular HYSA, e.g., required balance or frequency of deposits and the number of allowed withdrawals without penalty, which has historically been six per month.
- Online-only banks generally offer better rates by passing on the savings of reduced overhead to the customer. Most savings accounts compound daily or monthly. Confirm the compounding frequency the get the maximum return.
### Certificate of Deposit (CD)
- The rate of return is usually comparable or better than an HYSA, but the ability to withdraw the money is more restrictive. Returns are also taxed as ordinary income, so the comparison to HYSAs is easy to make. Again, not a high enough return retirement planning option.
### Bonds
- [Bond investment](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0312/the-basics-of-bonds.aspx) can be thought of similar to CDs, because the investment is generally long term and interest is taxed at ordinary income rates, but **bonds offer better tax advantages depending on the type of bond and certain bond types can be sold on the bond market.**
- After the initial issue of a bond to an investor, **bonds that can be traded on the secondary market can result in a capital gain or capital loss**. The value of the bond increases or decreases based on supply and demand of a bond's perceived value similar to buying and selling stock.
- Therefore, **the actual return on a bond takes into consideration the yield rate** (the interest paid to the investor) **and capital gain or loss if the investor chooses to sell the bond before its maturity date** (the date when the bond stops paying interest) . Remember that ordinary income and capital gains are taxed at different rates when calculating an overall return. The periodic monetary interest payment to a bond owner is known as the coupon payment. Payment periods are generally annual, semi-annual, or quarterly.
- Debt issued by the government goes by different names depending on the type and term lengths.
	- EE Bonds are a low-risk, long-term savings option with a fixed interest rate, guaranteed doubling after 20 years, and some tax advantages. They are designed to encourage saving for the future, but generally offer the lowest rate of return.
	- I-bonds are a type of US government savings bond designed to prevent devaluation caused by inflation. Generally there are two rates that determine the interest rate of an I-bond: a fixed rate and a variable inflation rate. The US Treasury Department has issued I-bonds with only a variable inflation rate during periods of high inflation. The variable rate is updated based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) every May and November. Interest payment for I-bonds is unique, because it is payed to the bondholder when the bond is redeemed through the US Treasury Department. This means the interest compounds tax deferred over the holding period. I-bonds have a 30-year maturity, but they can be redeemed after 1 year. If sold before 5 years, the last 3 months of interest is sacrificed.

	- [U.S. Bonds vs. Bills vs. Notes: What's the Difference?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-bills-notes-and-bonds/) (investopedia.com)
		- Treasury Bills (T-Bills): No periodic interest payments; bills are sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity in 1 year or less.
		- Treasury Notes (T-Notes) pay semiannual interest every 6 months, with maturities between 2 to 10 years.
		- Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds) also pay semiannual interest every 6 months, with maturities of 10 to 30 years.
- U.S. Savings Bonds are non-transferable, meaning they cannot be traded on the bond market, but they can be passed on through inheritance. The two types are:
	- EE Bonds
	- I-Bonds
	- Both offer educational expense tax advantages as well as tax deferral or current year interest reporting for EE bonds held by low or no income individuals, such as minors.
- Bonds are rated prior to issuing for sale to the public and ratings can change over the life of the bond. Higher yielding bonds generally receive a higher risk rating, and are commonly referred to as *junk* bonds.
	- Corporate bonds carry higher risk than government bonds (assuming the government and national currency is stable).

- Call Risk refers to the possibility that a bond issuer may redeem, or call, the bond before its maturity date, typically when interest rates decline (and the bond issuer does not want to continue paying the higher interest rate). This can result in investors losing out on future interest payments and having to reinvest the principal at lower rates. Callable bonds, such as many corporate and municipal bonds, may offer higher yields to compensate for this risk. U.S. Treasury Bonds and most savings bonds are generally not susceptible to early redemption. Callable bonds often include a yield-to-call (YTC) calculation, which helps investors assess potential returns if the bond is called early.
- **Bond investing is generally the most secure way to maintain a certain percentage of portfolio gains while continuing to maximize gains at a tolerable risk-to-reward ratio when approaching, and throughout retirement.**
- Investors should be aware of how certain bond interest is affected by other sources of income such as Social Security, as in the case of [municipal bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing-strategy/090116/think-twice-buying-taxfree-municipal-bonds.asp). See [Taxes -> Bonds](../taxes.md#bonds)<!-- #internal_link --> for a summary of bond taxation rules.
- Bonds are an annual tax consideration when held in taxable accounts.
### Key Differences Between Early Withdrawal from a CD vs. Selling a Bond Early

| **Factor**              | **CD Early Withdrawal**                                                                                                                                                                               | **Bond Sale Before Maturity**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Penalty/Cost**        | Early withdrawal usually results in a **penalty**. The penalty is typically the **forfeiture of interest** earned, and in some cases, even part of the principal (especially for long-term CDs, though this is rare).      | When selling a bond early, there is no **fixed penalty**. Instead, the bond may be sold for more or less than the purchase price, resulting in a **capital gain** or **capital loss**, depending on market conditions.                                                |
| **Effect on Principal** | In most cases, **the principal is not at risk**, but the **interest earned could be forfeited**, and in some rare cases (like long-term CDs), part of the principal might be taken as part of the penalty. | The **principal can fluctuate**, depending on whether the bond is sold at a premium (above par value) or at a discount (below par value). You could receive more or less than your original investment based on interest rates and market conditions.                 |
| **Liquidity**           | **Low liquidity** because the CD is locked in for the term of the investment. Early withdrawal is subject to penalties, and not all banks may allow for early withdrawal without penalty.             | **High liquidity** because bonds can be sold at any time in the secondary market. However, the market price will depend on factors such as interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer.                                                                     |
| **Market Impact**       | There is **no market risk** with a CD since the interest rate and penalty are fixed by the bank. The penalty is pre-defined.                                                                          | The market price of a bond **fluctuates** based on factors like **interest rates** and the bond’s **credit risk**. If rates rise or the bond issuer’s credit deteriorates, the bond’s price could drop, leading to a potential loss when sold early.                  |
| **Taxes**               | **Interest** earned on a CD is taxed as **ordinary income**. Early withdrawal does not affect the tax treatment, except for the forfeiture of interest, which would reduce the taxable amount.        | Interest from a bond is taxed as **ordinary income**. However, if the bond is sold for a **capital gain**, that gain will be taxed either as **short-term** or **long-term** capital gains, depending on how long the bond was held. Capital losses can offset gains. Also, note that municipal bond interest is often exempt from federal taxes, and sometimes state and local taxes. |

## Equities
- Shares of ownership of a publicly traded company, i.e. public stocks. Stock gains are taxed at capital gains rates, and losses may be deducted up to a certain amount each year with carryover allowed into future tax years. Some equities pay dividends, i.e., company profits shared with shareholders while an investor owns the stock. Investors can direct their broker to automatically reinvest dividends by purchasing additional shares. Like bonds, dividend paying stocks are a tax consideration when held in a taxable account.
- **Equities are the best financial market asset for growing an investment portfolio** and are also susceptible to the largest declines during economic downturns. 
## Commodities
- Investments in physical goods, such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. Contracts based on an agreed upon price at a future delivery date are bought and sold on the futures market. A contract may be sold before the actual delivery of goods. Commodities are **not advised** for individual investors, especially for the casual investor or someone focused on their retirement account. 
## Index Funds
- A type of ETF or mutual fund that tracks a specific market index, i.e. a predetermined set of individual assets such as the equities contained in the S&P 500. Index funds make it easy to focus on a particular market sector, e.g., energy or technology, or diversify your capital. They can include equities or bonds or a combination (i.e. hybrid/balanced funds).
- **Broad market index funds are the primary investment vehicle a retirement investor should be purchasing for a high return on investment for a relatively low risk when invested over a long term period.**
- The reason broad market indexes, aka indices, perform consistently well with minimal risk over time is because investing in a diverse group of assets, such as the S&P 500, the entire US market, or even the world market means that all of the companies in the fund would have to perform poorly for the fund to perform poorly. While there will be periods of poor performance for such indices, the corporations that make up any given index consist of highly motivated people who want their company to perform well. Moreover, a company must meet the performance based standards of an index or it will be replaced by another.
- Fund managers are responsible for creating and maintaining the fund to have the proper securities and proportions close to the index it follows. Index fund management is synonymous with passive management and index fund investing is known as passive investing.
- The [Wilshire 5000](https://www.wilshireindexes.com/products/ft-wilshire-5000-index-series) is a US equities index that is often used as a benchmark and worth considering as the bulk investment for domestic equity allocation if a low cost fund can be found.
## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
- ETFs can track indices or contain of a particular set of assets, making them either passively or actively managed. ETFs are available for a variety of asset types with varying levels of diversification.
- ETFs are unique in their turnover, i.e. the selling and repurchasing of securities within the fund by managers, as they seek to allocate the assets to meet the desired goals such as tracking an index. ETF turnover is done with *in-kind* redemption meaning that shares are effectively exchanged for new shares without the intermediary step of holding cash from the sale until different shares are purchased. Therefore, ETF turnover does not trigger a taxable event in the form of a typical capital gain or loss for shareholders.
- A simple way to understand the tax advantage of ETFs is to compare turnover to a mutual fund that holds the exact same shares:
	- Mutual fund turnover will result in capital gains distributions (income for a shareholder) and be subject to capital gains tax for that year.
	- ETF turnover defers capital gains distributions until the shareholder sells their shares.
	- Holding ETFs in a tax deferred account does not offer any additional tax benefit over a mutual fund. 
- Dividends and interest payments are still subject to tax for the year they are paid out when an ETF is held in a taxable brokerage account. Distribution of payments to shareholders normally occurs in December. The 12-month yield or trailing twelve month (TTM) yield is the percentage of a fund distributed to shareholders annually.
- Some ETFs may be proprietary to a specific broker, but since ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks on an exchange they are usually available through other brokers. Commission free securities trading that has become the industry standard applies to ETFs. If you need to move your account to a different broker, check for broker fees, even though ETFs are treated in-kind.
- ETFs became available to investors in 1993.
## Mutual Funds
- Similar to ETFs, mutual funds can be actively or passively managed. The turnover rate may be similar to active and passive ETFs, but turnover in mutual funds triggers a taxable event when held in a taxable accounts, which can lead to what is known as tax drag<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. Interest and dividends from assets held in taxable accounts are taxed the same as for ETFs. Distribution of payments to shareholders normally occurs in December. The 12-month yield or trailing twelve month (TTM) yield is the percentage of a fund distributed to shareholders annually.
- Traditional mutual funds are not bought and sold on an exchange. They are purchased directly from the fund provider, which can be a broker or a third party financial institution. Mutual funds are typically purchased through a broker and broker-specific mutual funds can often be purchased through other brokers as well. Pay attention for typically higher transaction fees when considering purchasing funds belonging to another broker or when moving funds from one broker to another. In-house fund offerings similar to those from other brokers are typically more cost efficient. The pricing of traditional mutual funds is set by fund's net asset value (NAV) which is calculated once a day after market close (although traditional mutual funds do not trade on exchanges, the fund assets do). After hours is the only time that mutual fund orders are executed.
- The simplest way to think about the differences between traditional mutual funds and ETFs is that ETFs trade like stocks and have the advantage of in-kind transfer for taxable accounts, while traditional mutual funds do not.
- Mutual funds have been around since the 1920s.
- Since 2016, hybrid funds called an exchange traded mutual funds or exchange traded managed funds (ETMFs) have been available for trading with similar tax advantages to ETFs. Although ETMFs trade throughout the day, their price is still set only once a day by the NAV. ETMFs are still relatively new and primarily actively managed, which does not fit into a long term passive investing plan.

These differences are subject to change and may already be negligible for some features depending on the broker, such as automatic reinvesting, so compare the costs and conveniences between brokers. Also, the pros and cons for passively managed ETFs and mutual funds for the average investor are generally closer than they seem at first glance as presented in the table.

| **Feature**                    | **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**                                                                                                                                        | **Mutual Funds**                                                                                                        |

	- **Lower fees** (especially for passive ETFs).
	- **More flexible**—you can trade them throughout the day.
	- **More tax-efficient** due to in-kind transactions.
	- **No minimum investment**—you can buy as little as one share.
	- **Highly liquid** and can be bought/sold easily, usually from any broker.
- **Cons**: 
	- Potential **brokerage commissions** (though many brokers now offer commission-free ETFs).
	- **May be more complicated** for beginners due to real-time trading.
	- **Bid/ask spreads** could increase trading costs, especially for less liquid ETFs.
#### Mutual Funds

	- **Automatic investment options** available, especially for retirement accounts.
	- **Flexibility** with both actively and passively managed funds.
	- **No trading commission** for mutual fund purchases through most brokers (though there may be other fees).

	- **Less tax-efficient**—capital gains may be distributed to investors annually.
	- **Less liquidity**—can only be traded at the end of the trading day.
	- May have **minimum investment requirements**, but since the introduction of zero dollar funds from some investment providers, this will likely become a trend.

## Fund Ratings
- MorningStar, who is considered one of the most reputable financial services companies for ranking past mutual fund performance, states that *past performance does not indicate future performance and should not be used to choose a fund*. Past performance of a specific fund other than broad market funds should never be used as the primary reason to pick one.

	>In 2014, _The Wall Street Journal_ requested that Morningstar produce a comprehensive list of five-star funds over 10 years starting in 2004. The publication discovered that 37% of funds lost one star, 31% lost two stars, 14% lost three stars, and 3% dropped down to one star. Only 14%, or 58 out of 403, retained their premium ratings.
	>
	>To express it a different way, investors invest money in a five-star mutual fund in the hopes of achieving five-star results moving forward, yet only 14% of such funds proved worthy of those hopes. If an investor was willing to accept a four- or five-star performance, the results were more palatable, since 51% of Morningstar's five-star funds in 2004 received a four-star or above rating in 2014.2

- The quotes above were used in a helpful article on the questionable [significance of fund ratings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013016/are-morningstars-best-mutual-funds-really-best-morn.asp) and the reliability of low expense ratios. While the index that a fund follows is important, once a broad market index is chosen, look for the lowest expense ratio. 
- To illustrate the futility in trying to predict the future of the stock market, a contest was set up that included professional financial analysts. See Page 164 (PDF page 189) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) for a description and table of results. Here is chart showing how [passive funds have historically outperformed actively managed funds](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=278454). 
## Private Placements
- Private placements are specially regulated investment offerings subject to less stringent declaration requirements and are intended for sophisticated, high net worth investors who are aware of the risks involved, e.g., venture capitalists. Private placements are **not advised** for the casual investor or someone focused on their retirement account.
