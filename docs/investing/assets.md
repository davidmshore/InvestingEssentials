### What is an Asset?
Assets are the things that investors acquire through purchase or trade with the intention of gaining a return, i.e. an increase in the value of the asset or a steady stream of income. Assets can be categorized by type, aka class, in accordance with their function and characteristics, including how their value generally goes up or down as related to other classes. Financial assets are non-physical products whose value is derived from the demand for them in a marketplace. Since the general rule to investing is that the greater the risk, the greater the reward, purchasing products that offer various risk and rates of return allow investors to customize their investment strategy to their needs. 
## Equities
- A type of financial security<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> that offers ownership of a publicly traded company, i.e. public stock shares. Stock gains are taxed at capital gain rates.
- Some equities pay a dividend, i.e. a portion of company profits that get distributed periodically to shareholders. Investors can direct their broker to automatically reinvest dividends by purchasing additional shares. Like fixed income assets, a dividend payment is an annual tax consideration when held in a taxable account.
- **Equities are the standard financial instrument for maximizing growth of investment capital** and are also vulnerable to the largest declines during economic downturns. 
- Most equities are issued as common stock, which have the greatest growth potential. There is another class of equities called preferred stock. Preferred is like a middle ground between common stock and fixed income securities, because they are not as volatile, typically pay a fixed dividend, and are usually found separate from either common stock or bonds when included in funds (fixed income securities, bonds, and funds will be covered below).
## Interest Earning Investments
- Debt investments are agreements between an investor (lender) in return for an interest payment from a borrower (debtor).
- The interest payment is represented as a percentage, aka yield, of the loan amount. This amount can be fixed or variable, but is typically fixed.
- Interest is taxed as ordinary income. Certain debt investments offer tax advantages.
### Savings Account
- Savings accounts are not traditional investment products, because the lender does not purchase the agreement, but the loan does receive interest and penalties affecting an investor's return do apply. A savings account should not be considered a retirement planning option or really even an investment. Their main purpose is to save for near-future spending expectations, generally 3-5 years where investing the money in the stock market is considered too risky and the rates and/or timeline for investing in other fixed income assets will not provide a better return. Some examples of saving are an upcoming vacation or automobile purchase. Calculating the difference between an HYSA's return versus comparably liquid<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> assets will help determine what the right choice should be.
- FDIC or NCUA insured [high-yield savings accounts](https://www.ourfirstfed.com/support/financial-education/basics-of-high-yield-savings-accounts) (HYSAs) are the best choice. 
- Review the details before opening a particular HYSA, e.g., required balance or frequency of deposits and the number of allowed withdrawals without penalty, which has historically been six per month.
- Online-only banks generally offer better rates by passing the reduced overhead savings on to the customer. Most savings accounts compound daily or monthly, and although it is only a small difference, the most frequent will earn the maximum return.
### Certificate of Deposit (CD)
- A debt agreement generally originating from a bank that pays a lender a rate of return in exchange for leaving the money invested for a set period called the term. It works like an IOU from a financial institution that slowly pays investors back. The purchaser is required to deposit a minimum amount in exchange for interest payments. At the end of the term, you receive your principle (deposit) back.
- The rate of return is typically better than HYSAs, but withdrawing the money prior to the term length usually results in a penalty.
- Like HYSAs, CDs do not provide a high enough return to be considered a retirement planning option.
- Bank issued CDs cannot be sold to other investors. 
- CDs can also be issued through brokerage companies as securities, in which case they can be sold to other investors. However, this is not as common and these are generally not as liquid as other fixed income securities which should make up the bulk of the average investor's interest earning investments.
### Fixed Income Securities
#### Overview
- [Fixed income securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) are investment products issued by an entity seeking a loan that provide periodic interest payments over a set period. 
- Fixed income securities are offered at what is called the face value, which is their principle value. The yield is the interest rate that is paid as a percentage of the face value at each payment interval. Fixed income does not necessarily mean that the yield will stay the same, but rather means that the security provides a fairly consistent stream of income. However, most fixed income securities are issued with a static yield.
- The periodic monetary interest payment to a security owner is known as the coupon payment. Payment periods are generally semi-annual, but can be annual or monthly depending on the security type.
- Certain securities offer tax advantages.
- Many securities<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> can also be resold, aka traded, on the secondary market, which can be thought of similar to the stock market. Trading on the secondary market can result in a capital gain or capital loss.
- The value of the security increases or decreases based on supply and demand of a security's perceived value similar to buying and selling stock.
	- For securities with a similar duration, the one with the highest yield will normally demand the highest price.
		- If the latest securities are offered at a higher yield than securities already on the market, then the price of the existing securities will go down.
		- If the latest securities are offered at a lower yield than securities already on the market, then the price of the existing securities will go up.
	- Price volatility, i.e. how susceptible a security is to price change, is correlated to the duration until maturity. This again has to do with the perceived value. Longer duration securities have a higher number of scheduled interest payments, so the sum of these payments is affected much more than the sum of a shorter duration security.  
		- The shorter the duration = less price volatility.
		- The longer the duration = more price volatility.
- The total return on a tradeable fixed income security takes into consideration the yield and capital gain or loss if an investor chooses to sell the security before its maturity date. Remember that ordinary income and capital gains are taxed at different rates when calculating an overall return. Additionally, fixed income securities may be issued at a discount from the face value which factors into the final return.
- Fixed income securities are rated prior to issuing for sale to the public and a rating can change over time depending on the stability of the issuer. Bonds are the most common type of fixed income security and may be issued by both the governments and private companies. Higher yielding bonds generally receive a higher risk rating, with the highest risk commonly referred to as *junk* bonds (bonds with a Standard & Poor's rating lower than BBB-). Since bonds are relatively safe compared to equities, high quality bonds are recommended instead of the highest yielding bonds.
- Investors should be aware that tax exempt interest is still added to modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which can affect how Social Security gets taxed.
- Debt investing is subject to various rules depending on the type and only the most common types are covered in brief summary below. Other than preferred stock that pay fixed dividends, fixed income investments are often lumped together with bonds for general discussion, but there are many differences between debt securities that investors need to consider depending on their goals. For more in-depth details see the Bogleheads' [outline of bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Outline_of_bonds).
- Except for U.S. savings bonds, most fixed income securities can be owned in bond funds (funds are covered below). Interest payments from bond funds are referred to as dividends though different from stock dividends—interest is taxed as ordinary income barring certain tax privileged exemptions. For the pros and cons of individual bond ownership versus buying a fund see page 36 (PDF page 63) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up).
#### U.S. Savings Bonds
- Savings bonds are free from state and local taxes, offer qualified education expense tax advantages and tax deferral, or the option for annual interest reporting for EE bonds. Immediate reporting may be to the advantage of low or no income investors if they will be in a higher tax bracket when the bonds are redeemed.
- There are two types, and each one must be held for a minimum of one year. If sold before 5 years, the last 3 months of interest is sacrificed. Savings bonds are purchased with after tax dollars from the Treasury Department.
- U.S. Savings Bonds are non-marketable, meaning they cannot be traded on the bond market, but they can be passed on through inheritance.
	- EE Bonds are a low-risk, long-term savings option with a fixed interest rate, guaranteed doubling after 20 years, and qualified tax advantages. They are designed to encourage saving for the future, but generally offer the lowest rate of return. EE bonds have different tax and yield rules depending on the year of issue and rules regarding whose name they are issued in to receive qualified education expense advantages, so be sure to read the details [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/EE_savings_bonds) (confirm last update at the bottom of the wiki page).
	- I-bonds are a type of U.S. government savings bond intended to keep up with inflation. Generally there are two rates that determine the interest rate of an I-bond: a fixed rate and a variable inflation rate. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued I-bonds with only a variable inflation rate during periods of high inflation. The variable rate is updated based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) every May and November. I-bonds have a 30-year maturity.
		- [Exact I-bond Interest Calculation Explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ug2deh/exact_ibond_interest_calculation_explanation/) (r/personalfinance)
		- I-bonds are not a guarantee for protecting the purchasing power of your dollars. Inflation rates, whether holding bonds in a tax-advantaged versus taxable account, and your tax bracket when income is received affect your overall return. See also page 49 (PDF page 76) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up).
- Although U.S. Savings Bonds may not have as attractive yields as other fixed income assets, the tax deferral and qualified tax-free usage may make them a worthwhile consideration. 
#### U.S. Treasuries
- Treasuries are securities issued by the U.S. Treasury Department that are exempt from state and local taxes.
- [U.S. Bonds vs. Bills vs. Notes: What's the Difference?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-bills-notes-and-bonds/) (investopedia.com)
	- Treasury Bills (T-Bills) do not provide periodic interest payments; bills are sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity in 1 year or less.
	- Treasury Notes (T-Notes) pay semiannual interest every 6 months, with maturities between 2 to 10 years.
	- Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds) also pay semiannual interest, with maturities of 10 to 30 years.
- Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are the second type of inflation protection bond from the U.S. Treasury other than I-bonds.
    - TIPS pay a fixed interest rate on the face value like other fixed income securities, but the face value is adjusted every six months based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This change in value is subject to capital gain or loss. 
    - The fixed interest rate on the current face value is paid semiannually.
    - Durations are 5-year, 10-year, or 30-year.
    - Unlike I-bond, TIPS cannot be redeemed early, and are subject to market demand if an investor wants to sell the bond prior to maturity.
    - TIPS offer principle protection, so the greater of either the original principal or adjusted face value is returned to the bond owner upon maturity.
    - TIPS are not a guarantee for protecting the purchasing power of your dollars. Inflation rates, whether holding bonds in a tax-advantaged versus taxable account, and your tax bracket when income is received affect your overall return. See also page 49 (PDF page 76) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up).
#### Municipal Bonds
- State and locally issued municipal bonds are federally tax free and generally free from state and local tax in the state or locality where bond is issued. Muni bonds are a considerable choice for high net worth investors. However, some municipal bonds may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->.
- Residents of states that tax income should look at single-state municipal bond funds matching their state. Look for funds holding the highest percentage of tax-exempt bonds. Muni funds have a minimum 80% of their assets in federally tax-exempt bonds.
- Taxable equivalent yield calculators determine the necessary rate of return for the after tax earnings of a taxable asset to compare to tax-exempt bond earnings. See also the Bogleheads' page on [municipal bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Municipal_bonds). 
#### Corporate Bonds
- Corporate bonds carry higher risk than government bonds. 
	- For more on corporate bond investing:
		- [Corporate bonds not recommended?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/wzwxud/corporate_bonds_not_recommended/) (r/Bogleheads)
		- [Corporate bonds beginner](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonds/comments/1e5oz14/corporate_bonds_beginner/) (r/bonds)
		- [How to Invest in Corporate Bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0612/how-to-invest-in-corporate-bonds.aspx) (investopedia.com)
- Corporate bonds may be correlated to the company's stock price during recession, possibly making them more susceptible to market downturns than government debt. 
- Call risk refers to the possibility that a bond issuer may redeem, or call, the bond before its maturity date, typically when interest rates decline, because the bond issuer does not want to continue paying the higher interest rate. This can result in investors losing out on future interest payments and having to reinvest the principal at lower rates. Bonds with a callable provision, such as many corporate and municipal bonds, may offer higher yields to compensate for this risk. U.S. Treasury Bonds and most savings bonds are generally not susceptible to early redemption. Callable bonds often include a yield-to-call (YTC) calculation, which helps investors assess potential returns if the bond is called early.
### Key Differences Between Early Withdrawal from a CD versus Selling a Bond Early

| **Factor**              | **CD Early Withdrawal**                                                                                                                                                                               | **Bond Sale Before Maturity**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Penalty/Cost**        | Early withdrawal usually results in a **penalty**. The penalty is typically the **forfeiture of interest** earned, and in some cases, even part of the principal (especially for long-term CDs, though this is rare).      | When selling a bond early, there is no **fixed penalty**. Instead, the bond may be sold for more or less than the purchase price, resulting in a **capital gain** or **capital loss**, depending on market conditions.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Effect on Principal** | In most cases, **the principal is not at risk**, but the **interest earned could be forfeited**, and in some rare cases (like long-term CDs), part of the principal might be taken as part of the penalty. | The **principal can fluctuate**, depending on whether the bond is sold at a premium (above par value) or at a discount (below par value). You could receive more or less than your original investment based on interest rates and market conditions.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Liquidity**           | **Low liquidity** because the CD is locked in for the term of the investment. Early withdrawal is subject to penalties, and not all banks may allow for early withdrawal without penalty.             | **High liquidity** because bonds can be sold at any time in the secondary market. However, the market price will depend on factors such as interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Market Impact**       | There is **no market risk** with a CD since the interest rate and penalty are fixed by the bank. The penalty is pre-defined.                                                                          | The market price of a bond **fluctuates** based on factors like **interest rates** and the bond’s **credit risk**. If rates rise or the bond issuer’s credit deteriorates, the bond’s price could drop, leading to a potential loss when sold early.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Taxes**               | **Interest** earned on a CD is taxed as **ordinary income**. Early withdrawal does not affect the tax treatment, except for the forfeiture of interest, which would reduce the taxable amount.        | Interest from a bond is taxed as **ordinary income**. However, if the bond is sold for a **capital gain**, that gain will be taxed either as **short-term** or **long-term** capital gain, depending on how long the bond was held. Capital losses can offset gains. Also, note that municipal bond interest is often exempt from federal taxes, and sometimes state and local taxes. |

### Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS)
- Securities representing mortgages paying interest at the current rates. As these can be a bit complex, only a brief summary will be provided here. For more details start with the Bogleheads' article on [mortgage-backed securities](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security).
- Issuers
	- Government-backed:
	    - Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) are fully backed by U.S. government's "full faith and credit".
	    - Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) have implicit government support (under conservatorship since 2008).
	    - Ginnie Mae (Government National Mortgage Association) have implicit government support (under conservatorship since 2008).
	- Private-label
		- Various banks and financial institutions, which come with a higher risk and no government guarantee.
- Rates
	- Rates fluctuate based on housing market and interest rates. Implicitly backed MBS may come with higher rates for the additional risk.
- Investing
	- Through mutual funds or ETFs specializing in MBS.
	- Individual MBS (minimum $25,000 for new-issue Ginnie Mae securities)
- Benefits
	- Regular monthly income stream
	- Generally lower risk than corporate bonds
- Risks
	- Prepayment by homeowners when interest rates change forcing investors to repurchase new securities with lower paying interest rates, aka call risk.
### Summary
The fixed income that bonds and inflation protected securities provide are generally the most secure ways to maintain a certain percentage of portfolio gains while continuing to maximize them at a tolerable risk-to-reward ratio when approaching and throughout retirement.
## Funds
Funds are a collection of assets that allow investors to purchase all of the underlying assets contained in a fund as a single product. They can include equities or bonds or a combination (i.e. hybrid/balanced funds). There are fundamentally only two types of fund products: exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.

The primary cost of owning a fund is called the expense ratio, which is equal to total management cost / total fund assets. This value is given as a percentage. As an investor this means your annual ownership cost is approximately equal to the value of your investment multiplied by the expense ratio. There are other costs that can affect your total annual cost, e.g., transactions fees, and these will be covered in a separate section under [minimize cost](general-investing-strategy.md#minimize-cost)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> in addition to how the exact expense ratio fee is calculated and charged.
### Index Funds
- An index fund is not investment product by itself, but rather describes a type of ETF or mutual fund that tracks a specific market index, i.e. a predetermined set of individual assets such as the equities contained in the S&P 500. Index funds make it easy to focus on a particular market sector, e.g., energy, technology, or value companies, or capture an entire market to easily diversify your capital.
- **Broad market index funds are funds containing a single class or multiple asset classes from diverse sectors. These types of funds are the primary investment vehicle a retirement planner should be purchasing for a relatively high return on investment for a relatively low risk, when invested over a long-term period.**
- The reason broad market indexes, aka indices, perform consistently well with minimal risk over time is because investing in a diverse group of assets, such as the S&P 500, the entire U.S. market, or even the world market means that all of the companies in the fund would have to perform poorly for the fund to perform poorly. While there will be periods of poor performance for indices, the corporations that make up any given index consist of highly motivated people who want their companies to perform well. A company must meet the performance based standards set by the index or it will be replaced by another. Lastly, if a broad market fund utterly fails there are much bigger problems going in the world than the value of your retirement account. 
- Fund managers are responsible for creating and maintaining the fund to have the proper securities and in proper proportion to closely mimic the index it follows. Index fund management is synonymous with passive management and index fund investing is known as passive investing. The selling and repurchasing of securities within a fund as managers seek to allocate the assets to meet the desired goals is called *turnover*. 
- The [Wilshire 5000](https://www.wilshireindexes.com/products/ft-wilshire-5000-index-series) is the largest U.S. equities index and is often used as a US benchmark.
- The [Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Barclays_US_Aggregate_Bond_Index) and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index are bond benchmark funds.
### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
- ETFs can track indices or contain of a particular set of assets, making them either passively or actively managed. ETFs are available for a variety of asset types with varying levels of diversification.
- ETFs are unique in their turnover. ETF turnover is done with *in-kind* redemption meaning that shares are effectively exchanged for new shares without the intermediary step of holding cash from the sale until different shares are purchased. Therefore, ETF turnover does not trigger a taxable event in the form of a typical capital gain or loss for shareholders.
- A simple way to understand the tax advantage of ETFs is to compare turnover to a mutual fund that holds the exact same shares:
	- Mutual fund turnover will result in capital gain distributions (income for a shareholder) and be subject to capital gain tax for that year.
	- ETF turnover defers capital gain distributions until a shareholder sells their shares.
	- Holding ETFs in a tax-deferred account does not offer any additional tax benefit over a mutual fund. 
- Dividends and interest payments are still subject to tax for the year they are paid out when an ETF is held in a taxable brokerage account. Distribution frequency can be found on a fund's fact sheet and the schedule is usually shown on a page that includes all of a fund provider's funds. The 12-month yield or trailing twelve month (TTM) yield is the percentage of a fund distributed to shareholders annually. Bond funds also have a duration rating, which is the weighted average until the maturity date of the fund's bond investments. 
- Some ETFs may be proprietary to a specific broker, but since ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks on an exchange they are usually available through other brokers. Commission free securities trading has become the industry standard. If you need to move your account to a different broker, check for broker fees, even though ETFs are treated in-kind.
- ETFs became available to investors in 1993.
### Mutual Funds
- Similar to ETFs, mutual funds can be actively or passively managed. The turnover rate may be similar to active and passive ETFs, but turnover in mutual funds triggers a taxable event when held in a taxable accounts, which can lead to what is known as tax drag<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. Interest and dividends from assets held in taxable accounts are taxed the same as for ETFs. Distribution of payments to shareholders normally occurs in December. The 12-month yield or trailing twelve month (TTM) yield is the percentage of a fund distributed to shareholders annually. Bond funds also have a duration rating, which is the weighted average until the maturity date of the fund's bond investments. 
- Traditional mutual funds are not bought and sold on an exchange. They are purchased directly from the fund provider. A provider can be a broker or a third party financial institution. Mutual funds are typically purchased through a broker and broker-specific mutual funds can often be purchased through other brokers as well. Pay attention for typically higher transaction fees when considering purchasing funds belonging to another broker or when moving funds from one broker to another. In-house fund offerings are typically more cost efficient. The pricing of traditional mutual funds is set by a fund's net asset value (NAV) which is calculated once a day after the close of the market where the fund assets are traded on. After hours is the only time that mutual fund orders are executed.
- The simplest way to think about the differences between traditional mutual funds and ETFs is that ETFs trade like stocks and have the advantage of in-kind transfer for taxable accounts, while traditional mutual funds do not.
- Mutual funds have been around since the 1920s.
- Since 2016, hybrid funds called an exchange traded mutual funds or exchange traded managed funds (ETMFs) have been available for trading with similar tax advantages to ETFs. Although ETMFs trade throughout the day, their price is still set only once a day by the NAV. ETMFs are still relatively new and primarily actively managed, which does not fit into a long-term passive investing plan. 
### Money Market Funds
- A money market fund (MMF) is a type of ETF or mutual fund that aims to provide a safe place to park your cash while earning a small return. They are often called *cash equivalents* because they're almost as safe and liquid as cash, which makes them suitable alternatives to other types of savings accounts.
- Money market funds are not the same as money market accounts used by banks and credit unions. MMFs are found at brokerage firms to attract customers to store their cash holdings with them rather than a HYSA bank account. 
- Assets are limited to short-term, low-risk fixed income securities like CDs, Treasury bills, and lowest-risk corporate debt, so some of the interest may be tax free depending on the state you live in. A Boglehead has created a [MMF optimizer spreadsheet](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=401821) to help track the most efficient funds with a handy filter for your state and tax brackets. Check the sheet for the latest update.
- Returns can be comparable to HYSAs depending on interest rates, but ownership expenses can be higher.
- Aims to maintain a stable value of $1 per share.
- Considered very low-risk, but not guaranteed like FDIC or NCUA insured accounts. However they are covered by the SIPC, which protects against the failure of brokerages, not against the fund assets' market performance.

| **Feature**                    | **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**                                                                                                                                                                 | **Mutual Funds**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimum Investment**         | **Pros**: No minimum investment requirement; you can buy as little as one share.                                                                                                                 | **Cons**: May have a minimum investment (e.g., $1,000 or $3,000).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Fees**                       | **Neutral**: Generally lower expense ratios than mutual funds, especially for passive ETFs.                                                                                                      | **Neutral**: Typically higher fees than ETFs, especially for actively managed funds. However, this depends on who the fund is purchased through and the type of fund. A broker's in-house, no-load index mutual funds offer comparably low expense ratios. |
| **Tax Efficiency**             | **Pros**: More tax-efficient due to in-kind transactions, reducing capital gain distributions.                                                                                                   | **Cons**: Less tax-efficient; mutual funds may distribute capital gains to investors annually when held in taxable accounts.                                                                                                                               |
| **Liquidity**                  | **Neutral**: Highly liquid; can be bought or sold throughout the day at market prices.                                                                                                           | **Neutral**: Less liquid; only bought/sold at the NAV, once per day. Not an issue for long-term investing.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Trading Costs**              | **Neutral**: Many brokers offer free trades. Cons: May incur commission fees for buying and selling.                                                                                             | **Neutral**: Similar to ETFs if front-end loads, back-end loads, redemption fees, and funds from other brokers are avoided.                                                                                                                                |
| **Investment Strategy**        | **Pros**: Passive management is common (track indices).                                                                                                                                          | **Pros**: Both passive (index) and active management are available, so you can choose.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Ease of Use**                | **Neutral**: Slightly more involved in real-time trading and bid/ask spreads. Trade executions are simple once an investor understands real-time pricing and how to use market and limit orders. | **Neutral**: Easier for beginners to set up, with options like automatic investment and dividend reinvestment.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Management Style**           | **Neutral**: Primarily passively managed, but actively managed ETFs are available.                                                                                                               | **Neutral**: There are many actively mutual funds, but plenty of low cost passive index funds as well.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Automation**                 | **Cons**: Lack of built-in automation, particularly for fractional share reinvesting of dividends and interest; investors need to place buy/sell orders.                                         | **Pros**: Many mutual funds offer automatic investment, reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and fractional share reinvesting.                                                                                                                      |
| **Fractional Share Investing** | **Neutral**: Many brokers offer fractional share investing, allowing you to invest with smaller amounts, but the feature may not be compatible with automatic reinvesting.                       | **Pros**: Mutual funds generally offer fractional share investing, enabling smaller investments.                                                                                                                                                           |

### Fund of Funds
- Balanced funds made up of other funds rather than individual stocks, bonds, etc., allowing an investor to invest in a single product containing their desired mix of assets. These funds offer convenience, but generally come at a slightly higher cost than owning funds individually.
### Target Date Funds
- A fund of funds that is set up to automatically rebalance the mix of assets from a riskier, more aggressive allocation toward a more conservative one, i.e. start with more capital in equities and slowly move it toward fixed income assets throughout the years. These funds offer convenience, but may come at a higher cost.
### Fund Ratings, Performance and Market Timing
- MorningStar, who is considered one of the most reputable financial services companies for ranking past mutual fund performance, states that *past performance does not indicate future performance and should not be used to choose a fund*. Past performance of a specific fund, other than a total market fund, should never be used as the primary reason to pick one.

	>In 2014, _The Wall Street Journal_ requested that Morningstar produce a comprehensive list of five-star funds over 10 years starting in 2004. The publication discovered that 37% of funds lost one star, 31% lost two stars, 14% lost three stars, and 3% dropped down to one star. Only 14%, or 58 out of 403, retained their premium ratings.
	>
	>To express it a different way, investors invest money in a five-star mutual fund in the hopes of achieving five-star results moving forward, yet only 14% of such funds proved worthy of those hopes. If an investor was willing to accept a four- or five-star performance, the results were more palatable, since 51% of Morningstar's five-star funds in 2004 received a four-star or above rating in 2014.

	\- The Wall Street Journal. [Mutual Funds' Five-Star Curse](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-funds-with-5-star-morningstar-ratings-10-years-ago-have-fared-1410120116) (paywalled after initial loading)

- The quotes above were used in a helpful article on the questionable [significance of fund ratings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013016/are-morningstars-best-mutual-funds-really-best-morn.asp) and the reliability of low expense ratios. While the index that a fund follows is important, once a broad market index is chosen, look for the lowest expense ratio, which has historically been the number one indicator of how well a fund will perform relative to similar funds. It doesn't matter who manages a passive fund. The one with the lowest cost for a given index is the best choice. [Costs](general-investing-strategy.md#minimize-cost)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> are covered in more detail later. 
- Due to the number of actively managed funds available to investors, index funds are rarely the top performing funds over short periods of time, which are the durations that media outlets often highlight funds by. However, index funds are almost never the worst performers either. Funds should not be considered by looking at their 5 or 10 year benchmarks, but for the entire duration of a funds existence.
	- When assessing fund performance, avoid the latest articles, third-party ratings, or recommendations from media spokespeople or fund companies themselves. Instead, simply look at the full history of a fund's performance, like the [example](../market-history-and-performance.md)<!-- #internal_link --> of the S&P 500. Look for index funds with decades of history. If a newer fund does not have a very long history, but is setup to track an index that does have decades of history, this can be used to observe historic performance). Online [charting](../resources/tools.md#charting)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> tools make this an easy task.
	- Here is table chart showing how [passive funds have historically outperformed actively managed funds](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=278454). 
- An entire chapter (page 153; PDF page 180) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) was dedicated to warning investors hoping to *beat the market*. Most importantly the average *long-term* returns of broad market index funds are better than the returns of professional actively managed funds for the same period, as well as self proclaimed newsletter experts, or anyone else claiming to be able to time the market.
- In summary, for investors hoping for a better than average return, understand that this is akin to gambling your retirement future against professionals. For investors starting later in life, the road to building retirement wealth may take longer you would hope, but there are really only a three choices: earn and invest more, work longer, or take on what is effectively a gamble with a high probability of *eventual* results that may or may not involve working longer. The latter would look something like investing your entire portfolio in a world equity fund since equities offer the greatest growth potential, and accept that if the markets take a downturn and require a very long recovery time, then you'll just continue working until it recovers.
## Precious Metals
- Physical Bullion
	- Gold, silver, or platinum coins, bars, or ingots can be purchased from reputable dealers. Transaction fees can reduce short-term investments returns.
- Mining Stocks
	- Companies involved in precious metals extraction and processing.
- Digital Precious Metals
	- It is possible to directly own physical metals stored in remote vaults. This gives investors the option to redeem their holdings for physical metal or cash. Transaction and maintenance fees are generally higher than owning metal equities.
- ETFs and Mutual Funds
	- Highly liquid indirect ownership of physical metal-backed funds, metal-related companies, or a combination.
- Basic tax considerations when investing in precious metals:
	- Short-term gains (assets held less than one year) are taxed as ordinary income.
	- The IRS classifies precious metals as collectibles, subject to a separate long-term capital gain tax rate with a higher maximum than securities at 28%.
	- ETFs and mutual funds that are backed by physical metals and contain metal-related stocks will be taxed at both collectibles and securities capital gain rates in proportion to each type of holding.
	- Additionally, futures-based commodity ETFs have their own special taxation rules that investors visiting this site should not be interested in.
- Due to the historic value of precious metals, only a small investment, if any, should be considered for the average investor. The largest broad market index funds generally include a small portion of mining stocks.
## REITs
- Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. These publicly traded securities offer investors highly liquid access to real estate returns without directly owning properties. REITs distribute 90% of their taxable income as dividends, providing a steady income stream for shareholders.
- REITs can be categorized into equity REITs, which own physical properties, and mortgage REITs, which finance real estate investments, or a combination of the two. REIT mutual funds or ETFs offer greater diversification.
- When considering REITs, investors should consider property quality, location, occupancy rates, and financial metrics such as funds from operations (FFO) and dividend yield (rate of return). 
## Other Financial Instruments
The following are listed for curious investors who may hear about these financial instruments or investing options so they can understand why they are not suitable for a long-term investing strategy.
### Commodities
- Commodities are raw physical goods used for commerce and manufacturing, such as oil, gas, agricultural products, and precious metals.
- An individual commodity may be purchased with a contract based on an agreed upon price at a future delivery/expiration date. Commodity contracts, also called futures contracts or simply futures, are a type of security that may be bought and sold on the futures market prior to the contract expiration. The futures market is a collection of exchanges separate from the bond and equity exchanges.
- Pricing can be thought of similar to bond pricing, where the latest perceived value of a commodity affects the price of existing contracts.
- Futures are primarily used for speculation, short-term hedging, or generating income by traders.
- Commodities may also be purchased in funds. Funds may hold multiple contracts and even multiple commodities with contracts expiring and being rolled over based on market pricing.
- Commodities are considered an advanced financial instrument, due to their potential volatility and requirement to accept the market price of the contract before the expiration date. There is no provision for a contract that has lost market value to move in the owners favor after the expiration date. Rollover of a contract involves settling the existing contract and purchasing a new contract with a future expiration.
- Futures are **not advised** for long-term passive investors.
### Options
- Options are contracts giving the right, but not obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price within a specific time frame. They are similar to futures contracts with an expiration and an agreed upon price, but do not require buying or selling the asset and are purchased at a fraction of the underlying asset price. The underlying assets that a contract may be based on include: equities, bonds, currencies, futures, or funds made up of any of these.
- Pricing can be thought of similar to futures pricing in that the latest perceived market value of the contract's underlying asset influences the price of existing contracts. The price of a contract is called the premium.
- Options can be used for speculation, hedging, or generating income by traders.
- Considered an advanced financial instrument, due to their potential volatility and requirement to accept the market price of the sale of contract before the expiration date or lose the full premium. 
- Requires understanding of complex strategies and market dynamics.
- Options are **not advised** for long-term passive investors.
### Private Placements
- Private placements are special less-regulated investment offerings intended for sophisticated, high net worth investors who are aware of the risks involved, e.g., venture capitalists. Private placements are **not advised** for the casual investor or someone focused on their retirement account.
## Annuities and Insurance
- Insurance is covered on page 243 (PDF page 270) of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up). Topics include: accident statistics, how much insurance to purchase, what is covered, age-related policy pricing considerations, insurance company ratings, and recommended websites as of 2014—[Clark.com](https://clark.com/story/clarks-websites/) may be used to cross-reference current recommendations as well.
- When an annuity or insurance product is linked to investment products, it adds a layer of expense for accessing these assets that needs to be carefully considered.
### Annuities
- Annuities are contracts between an individual and an insurance company or charity, where the annuity owner pays into the annuity in installments or a lump sum in exchange for periodic payments for a set period. One of the primary appeals of annuities is that the agreement can be set up to last for the life of the [annuitant](https://www.annuity.org/annuities/annuitant/) (recipient), which may help reduce the risk of running out of money after retirement.
- Annuities fall into [two primary categories](https://www.thrivent.com/insights/annuities/the-4-types-of-annuities-which-is-right-for-you) and each has two options for when to receive payment: fixed or variable with either immediate or deferred payment. Fixed offer a guaranteed amount that may be lower than variable annuities. Variable are linked to investment products that can be affected by market conditions.
- While there are some similarities and advantages to other tax-advantaged accounts like tax-deferred growth, annuities are generally not considered a worthwhile purchase when compared to other investment options. An insurance company needs to invest the money paid by the annuity owner and keep a portion of the investment return for itself. Remember the difference that a relatively small percentage change in investment return makes when compounding? Still, annuity income can provide emotional relief for retired individuals worried they might outlive their savings.
- Annuities are typically a consideration for later in life when investments will be drawn down rather than built up, and an investor wants to add another guaranteed monthly income stream to their social security. This amount is partially based on life expectancy, so the older the annuitant is when they begin receiving payments the higher this amount will be.
- As the years go on, look into how annuities work and their overall return, compare them to other tax-advantaged accounts and low risk fixed income securities, and consider general statistics and your family genes concerning your mortality. There may still be plenty of time for compounding when it comes time to consider if an annuity should be an option. High income investors who regularly max out their tax-advantaged retirement accounts may want to consider an after-tax, tax-deferred annuity purchased outside of a retirement account. Also called qualified annuities, these do not have a contribution limit or any withdrawal requirements, but contributions are non-deductible.
- An annuity as a tax-free gifting vehicle may be worth considering if maximizing a gift rather than maximizing retirement income is the goal.
- Annuities often sound better than they are. Before seriously considering an annuity it is advised to meet with a professional, fee-only [financial planner](../professional-advisors.md)<!-- #internal_link --> to make sure the details are fully understood. Considerations should include the variability of payout, term length, cancellation penalties, surrender fees, add-ons like a term-certain payout/beneficiary rider, a nursing home rider, a terminal illness rider, an inflation rider, the long-term financial health of the insurer, how much of the annuity relies on them, and how sales commissions and fees reduce the income stream compared to other investment options.
- See also, [Annuities Unveiled: A Guide to the Different Types of Annuities](https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/annuities-unveiled-guide-different-types-annuities),  [Do You Need an Annuity for Retirement Income?](https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/do-you-need-an-annuity-retirement-income), and [Charitable Gift Annuity: Meaning, Regulations, FAQs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charitable-gift-annuity.asp).
### Life Insurance
- While insurance falls under the necessities category when creating a budget, certain types of life insurance can be linked to investment products like stocks or bonds. Life insurance should typically only be a consideration while you have dependents and if investment income would be insufficient to support them.
- There are two main categories of life insurance: term (temporary) and whole (permanent). If you are looking for a life insurance policy to provide temporary income for dependents after the untimely death of a provider, term life insurance should be the primary choice.
- Whole life, universal life, or variable universal life policies are the ones that you may hear pitched as an investment opportunity. Like annuities, these products are generally not considered worthwhile when compared to other options, but the insurance benefit might add enough to the overall value of an investment plan in [some scenarios](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/is-whole-life-insurance-good-investment) such as:
	- Lifetime dependents, e.g., a disabled loved one
	- Hybrid life/long-term care insurance
	- Pay estate taxes
	- Pay final expenses and debt, such as burial and medical bills
	- Leverage a life insurance policy loan
	- For high net worth investors who have maxed out their tax-advantaged accounts
- For additional overview on the fundamental workings and subtypes of life insurance search episodes of the Clark Howard or Money Girl podcast.
- If you think a whole life policy might be to your advantage, discuss the possibility with a [financial planner](../professional-advisors.md) who does not sell any products or have a conflict of interest on the matter.
