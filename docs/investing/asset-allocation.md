## The Simple Portfolio
- A portfolio refers to all of the investments that an investor has put their money into.
- Asset allocation, tax efficiency and low expenses are the three keys to maximizing returns.
- To stick with the overall idea of keeping things simple, diversification is the simplest way to ensure steady growth and remain balanced during market declines (i.e. experience a less dramatic drawdown, not cancel out the effects of a decline in the overall market).
- Many investors opt for the simplest options, such as target date funds (TDFs) or one of the Bogleheads' [lazy portfolios](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios) which definitely make getting started easy. Both are far superior options than waiting to start and can be modified at any point (consider the tax bill if in a taxable accounts). This simplified answer to a Redditor on [Boglehead thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/12623ff/comment/je79z9v/) may help wrap up your understanding. 
	- The main considerations with a target date fund are whether the fees are low enough to justify letting it run its course, if the investor is okay with the path that the portfolio will take, and whether you are disciplined enough to periodically reallocate the assets of your portfolio, aka rebalance. When the fees are low enough and a diversified fund looks like it should perform well, then [TDFs are acceptable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1er9lrb/should_one_even_bother_with_targetdate_allinone/), but understand that they are simply predetermined rebalancing plans. They may not perform as well as an investor's portfolio with different allocation.
	- Most of the time your money will sit in an investment account and need only be managed once a year. An investor can always look at the glide path of a TDF and follow it in a manually managed account. For investors starting later in life who opt to use a TDF, choosing a later target date is one option to allocate more of the fund toward more aggressive equities growth. Switching funds in retirement accounts is tax free and the difference in returns when starting out with a small account is irrelevant, so try something out and see how you like it. Confirm there are no workplace plan or broker fees that will make switching costly.
- The rule of 110 is the basis for a simple allocation strategy that states that 110 minus a person's age is the percentage of a portfolio that should be invested in equities. The final allocation heading into and throughout retirement is often capped with a higher percentage of equities, and some investors choose to remain heavily invested in equities (80/20 or 90/10 equity/debt) until 10 to 25 years from retirement when annual rebalancing will begin. General conventions say to aim toward a more conservative strategy. The balancing timeline, aka glide path, and final allocation will be up to each individuals' risk tolerance and the market conditions.
	- The logic of the rule is that equities provide the best opportunity for a portfolio to grow, especially when an investor is young and has time to allow for market fluctuations, while gradually reducing the amount of capital invested in stocks ensures that an adequate portion of the gains are safer from recession when getting closer to and throughout retirement. 
	- It is common to see a recommendation for 5% of one's portfolio in money market fund or high yield savings account using this method, with the remainder in other fixed income securities after the equity allocation. This is primarily for retirees. Since they are no longer earning income it makes sense to have a short term cash buffer in case of a recession.

- Chapter 8 of the [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) (page 89; PDF page 116) is recommended as mandatory reading. It covers asset allocation and sub-allocation of the primary asset groups, fund suggestions, and some basic market theory. New investors should have a layman's understanding of market theory but be more concerned with getting started using diversified low cost index funds in proper allocations as early in life as they can. Risk optimization theories beyond simply owning broad market funds can be learned along the way.
- There are many more [lazy allocation strategies](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/lazy-portfolios/) that investors may want to consider. Here is a quick [example](https://youtu.be/3PzftQdvpis?si=6BuMClLFktBeZ4Fn&t=300) of how to test them in Portfolio Visualizer.
## Considerations
- Risk
	- How correlated are asset classes and how long is your investment timeline.
- Diversification
	- Diversification adds risk protection. If using multiple funds, pay attention that they are not highly correlated.
- Estimated Return
	- The **after tax rate of return = pre-tax rate of return x (1 - effective tax rate)** 
	- Costs
		- Details regarding an investment may be found in the asset's [prospectus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp), which is the most reliable source of information about potential investments. Workplace retirement plans should have a Summary Plan Description (SPD) that tells an employee what fees and expenses are charged and if it is up to the employee or employer to pay them. There are additional documents that an employee may request detailing how an employer is paying fees and expenses.
- Taxable or tax-advantaged account?
	- Tax-efficient assets (e.g., qualified dividends) should go in taxable accounts and inefficient assets (e.g., ordinary dividends and bonds) should go in tax-advantaged accounts.
## Equities
- While the rule of 110 is very easy to maintain, investors starting later in life may want to have more in equities while considering the risk-to-reward, such as how many more years could the investor continue working if the market were to crash nearing retirement.
#### Equities Subdivision Suggestions
- <=10% tilt
	- Tilt refers to allocating a larger portion of a portfolio into a particular sector, e.g., technology, energy, finance, etc., or style of an asset class e.g., equity styles include value, growth, dividend, size, quality, etc.
	- It is generally not recommended to focus too much on a specific tilt, and some would argue what is the point if the overall market is sufficient and has a proven track record? Once a tilt is chosen you have to hold to your chosen tilt for it have time to outperform the overall market benchmark, which may last decades.
	- The [Morningstar Style Box](https://advisor.morningstar.com/enterprise/MorningstarStyleBox_FactSheet.pdf) is a simple visual tool that categorizes funds and stocks based on their investment style and market capitalization. It uses a 3x3 grid that is marked with the overall balance of the characteristics of a fund, including whether it focuses on large, mid, or small companies and whether it leans towards value, growth, or a blend of both. The Style Box is found near the statistics on a fund's page.
- <=10% REIT
	- REITs tend to focus on a certain type of real estate, e.g., apartments, shopping centers, storage units, etc., so an index fund of REITs can be used to diversify.
- <=20 to 40% global equities for U.S. investors
	- Global allocation depends on the stability of the domestic economy and world trends. It can help smooth out periods of poor domestic stock market performance. However, being heavily tilted in one and telling yourself you will rebalance *after market conditions change* can and will eventually leave you in a down market that can take years to recover from.
	- Recency bias is a real threat to optimistic investors who are not conservatively allocated nearing retirement. This may have more to do with fixed income allocation than sub-allocation of equity, but it is still a consideration that should not be overlooked.
	- International investing depends on both the companies and the [foreign currency](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1hxdq7f/can_someone_explain_how_currency_exchange_affects/).
- These values may be adjusted. Overall, a 60% to 80% domestic equities allocation is generally recommended.

## Fixed Income
- Apart from physical property and a few minor tertiary financial products, your portfolio debt allocation will primarily be determined inversely to your equity allocation.
- Consider the number of working years you have left, your financial goals and how your portfolio's rate of return will be affected by moving more into debt investments.
- Reminders:
	- Interest earning assets have a low correlation to the stock market, and can even move in the opposite direction.
	- As with any debt investment, look for the best yields with acceptable risk and compare the tax efficiency of different asset for taxable accounts. 
	- Duration (period until maturity) should be <= time until a debt investment needs to be withdrawn. 
## Guidance
- Up front, it is important for new investors not to feel like they are getting overwhelmed. At this point if you understand the basic allocation of a lazy portfolio then once you understand how to create your own using the lowest cost funds, it is perfectly acceptable to get started and just follow the glide path of a target date fund. Some investors choose this or the TDF for their lifelong investing strategy.
- Rob Berger's video on [portfolio evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdo0wo1_ams) summarizes how an investor can go about balancing a portfolio.
### Correlation
- So far we know that the market has historically gone up. and that owning a broadly diversified mix of assets from various sectors ensures that no one part of our portfolio should be allowed to pull the overall balance down too much. So how do we know which mix of assets and styles is safest to mix with others to minimize our risk? We can use historical averages to make some assumptions. Owning the whole market with a mix of equities and fixed income products is a good way to start. To further optimize a portfolio against overall risk, investors use can use a statistical measure called R-Squared to compare how different asset classes relate to each others or how funds relate to their benchmark indices.
	- A value of 1 means that assets move exactly the same as each other.
	- A value of 0 means that the movement of one asset is not correlated to the other.
	- A value of -1 means that assets move exactly opposite of each other.
- Charts

	- [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-class-correlations)
	- The [Callan Periodic Table of Investment Returns](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Callan_periodic_table_of_investment_returns) displays historical returns of asset classes for a rolling 20 year period.
- Calculators

- Fund providers usually list their R-Squared on a fund's page.
- Low asset correlation with high fund performance make for the ideal portfolio product.
### Other Metrics
- This website does not intend to introduce you to the abundance of metrics that investors have the option of using (or getting lost with). Remember that history has shown the futility of trying to beat the market. Analyzing the market through the use of various calculations is one of the ways that so-called financial experts can make themselves sound like they know something others might be missing out on. Individual investors can get lost in the financial forest among the trees of criteria as well. However, it is good to know some high level metrics that may help you understand how to allocate your portfolio a few percentage points this way or that regarding equities to debt. 
	- The price-to-earnings, or price per earnings (P/E), ratio is the most ubiquitous fundamental analysis metric that can be used for individual stocks, indices, or the entire market. The higher the price per share for a company's stock compared to its earnings per share gives a clue as to how much demand there for a company relative to its performance, but more realistically the measurement can be used to compare relative companies. Similarly, an index that measures the entire market can be assessed by its P/E ratio.
	- The [Shiller Price-to-Earnings Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cape-ratio.asp), aka Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earning (CAPE) Ratio, uses the average inflation adjusted earnings for the last ten years to give us a longer-term valuation.
	- Like all measurements of history, past performance is not a guarantee of future performance, but knowing that big changes in the market occur from time to time and understanding a few metrics can help investors get an idea of where the current market valuation stands. As the famous quote ascribed to Mark Twain goes, "History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes".
	- Every product in life has a sale price at one point or another. The problem is no one knows how high or low the market might go before a direction change, which is why it is good to be reminded that a long-term dollar-cost averaging approach is the safest way to ensure your dollars have time to grow before locking in some of the gains.
## Rebalancing
- Rebalancing refers to the reassignment of how much money is staked in each of the asset classes and tilts in a portfolio.
- The five main factors when considering rebalancing a portfolio are imbalances due to large gains or losses in certain asset classes, improper allocation of contributions made throughout the year, age, taxes, and costs. Reviewing chapters 8 and 17 of [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://archive.org/details/null-1_202312/mode/2up) annually as a refresher can help with maintaining your target goals.
	- Review your goals before the year end if any reallocation of taxable brokerage accounts may be needed.
	- See also [Taxes -> End of Year Checklist](../taxes.md#end-of-year-checklist).
- Robo-advisors and target date funds offer convenient rebalancing management.
