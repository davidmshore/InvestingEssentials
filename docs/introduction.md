### *A rising tide lifts all boats*.

Capitalism benefits the wealthy the most, but most people are never taught how to get the most out of their access to their wealth or take advantage of compound interest.

The study of the financial markets can be about as complex as some of the most intensely studied scientific fields in the world [if someone wants to hunt for market inefficiencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5w-dEgIU1M), but by simply reviewing historical patterns, understanding the fundamentals to investing, taking advantage of the [principle of compounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf91rEGw88Q), and keeping things simple, ending up with a relatively secure financial future is easier to start, maintain, and attain than just about any other major asset a person may own in life. This is summarized in the [Prime Directive flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpeg) from [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/?rdt=48190). Focus on learning and utilizing the basics before getting too far off the main path to financial growth. There are advanced investment strategies that may or may not be beneficial to the reader, and these will become easier to understand after the basic concepts, rules, and especially tax laws become second nature.

It is important to have the right mindset and realize that investing is a long game, so the time to start is usually now. Here are a couple of discussions that touch on topics that every investor who is late to the game will ask.

- [Investors who started in their 30s - Where are you now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/vhg9r2/investors_who_started_in_their_30s_where_are_you/) (r/Bogleheads)
- [People that started investing/saving late in life (40+)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/17od8by/people_that_started_investingsaving_late_in_life/) (r/Bogleheads)

This content is general in nature, and intended to provide readers with a base level knowledge about investing to get them started on their own. There can be a plethora of options to look into when trying to put together the *best* plan, i.e. the one that will end up with the best payback, i.e. return on investment, but the reality is this will change as life moves forward and things like health coverage change, a spouse or kids join the future, new tax credit opportunities, etc. are introduced. The good news is the overall plan will not need much adjusting, when it does it will be minor, and most of it can be modified along the way without penalty.

First up is understanding how to approach financial freedom, and as every investor will learn the answer to a lot of questions will start with *that depends on what your goals are*. The best advice for one person may be subpar or detrimental to another. After learning the basics, if managing things becomes too time consuming or complex, some investors may be able to improve their return on investment with the help of a financial advisor. For the average investor just starting out, things can be managed fairly simply.

Before investing plans can be put into action, your spending history may be needed, to know where waste can be converted into savings and investment.
