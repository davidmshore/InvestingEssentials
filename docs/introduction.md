### *A rising tide lifts all boats*.

Capitalism benefits the wealthy the most, but the average person does not take advantage of their access to their wealth or the principle of compounding.

The study of the financial markets can be about as complex as some of the most intensely studied scientific fields in the world if someone wants to hunt for [market inefficiencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5w-dEgIU1M). However, by reviewing historical patterns, taking advantage of [compounded earnings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf91rEGw88Q), and keeping things simple, ending up with a relatively secure financial future is easier to start, maintain, and attain than just about any other major asset a person may own in life. This is summarized in the [Prime Directive flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpeg) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) from [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/?rdt=48190). There are advanced investment strategies that may or may not be beneficial to the reader, and these will become easier to understand after the basic concepts and rules become ingrained in your thinking.

There can be a number of options to look into when trying to put together a plan for the best return on investment, i.e. the greatest increase in value. The reality is the details of that plan will probably change as life moves forward, e.g., personal health needs, access to work sponsored programs, the addition of a spouse or children, law changes, etc. The good news is that for the overwhelming majority of people a well planned investment scheme will not need much adjusting, and when it does it will only require a few minutes a year if not left up to automation.

First up is understanding how to approach financial freedom. As every investor will learn, the answer to a lot of questions will be *that depends on what your goals are*. The best advice for a particular investor at their stage in life may be subpar or detrimental to another. After learning the basics, if your particular scenario makes managing things too time consuming or complex, some investors may want to seek the help of a professional financial advisor. For the average investor just starting out, managing your investments is actually very simple. Learning to do it yourself can almost certainly guarantee you will have more money for your financial goals. Even when professional help is utilized, it can be for confirmation or guidance on how to continue managing a plan yourself.

Before investing plans can be put into action, your spending history is needed to know where waste can be converted into savings and investment.
