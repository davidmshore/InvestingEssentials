### *A rising tide lifts all boats*.

Capitalism benefits the wealthy the most, but most people are never taught how to get the most out of access to their wealth or take advantage of compound interest.

The study of the financial markets can be about as complex as some of the most intensely studied scientific fields in the world [if someone wants to hunt for market inefficiencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5w-dEgIU1M). However, by reviewing historical patterns, understanding the fundamentals to investing, taking advantage of the [principle of compounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf91rEGw88Q), and keeping things simple, ending up with a relatively secure financial future is easier to start, maintain, and attain than just about any other major asset a person may own in life. This is summarized in the [Prime Directive flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpeg) ([non-US versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) also available) from [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/?rdt=48190). Focus on learning and utilizing the basics before getting too far off the main path to financial growth. There are advanced investment strategies that may or may not be beneficial to the reader, and these will become easier to understand after the basic concepts, rules, and especially tax laws become second nature.

It is important to have the right mindset and realize that investing is a long game, so the time to start is now. Here are a couple of discussions that touch on topics that every investor who is late to the game will ask.

This content is general in nature, and intended to provide readers with a base level knowledge about investing to get them started on their own. There can be a number of options to look into when trying to put together the *best* plan, i.e. the one that will end up with the best return on investment. The reality is the details will probably change as life moves forward, e.g., personal health requirements, work sponsored programs, a spouse or kids join the future, new tax credits are introduced, etc. The good news is that when planned correctly the overall scheme will not need much adjusting, when it does it will be minor, and any modifications along the way will be free from penalty.

First up is understanding how to approach financial freedom, and as every investor will learn the answer to a lot of questions will start with *that depends on what your goals are*. The best advice for a particular person at their stage in life may be subpar or detrimental to another. After learning the basics, if managing things becomes too time consuming or complex, some investors may be able to improve their return on investment with the help of a financial advisor. For the average investor just starting out, managing their investments is actually simple.

Before investing plans can be put into action, your spending history may be needed to know where waste can be converted into savings and investment.
