Understanding how the [assets](investing/assets.md) mentioned in this section work will aid your comprehension of some of the rules and concepts.
## Key Points
- Selling securities for a capital gain or loss **within a tax-advantaged account (a pre/post-tax retirement or education account or HSA)** does not trigger a [taxable event](https://www.financestrategists.com/retirement-planning/ira/can-you-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-an-ira/), i.e. no tax is owed on the gains and no tax deduction may be used due to a loss.
- **Withdrawals from a pre-tax retirement account** are taxed as ordinary income.
- Selling securities for a profit **within a brokerage account** triggers a taxable event. A gain is taxed as either short term (the same tax rates as ordinary income), or long-term (more favorable tax rates) depending on how long the investment product was owned. The rules favor long-term investing to help companies grow, and investors are given a lower tax rate if they wait at least a year before selling their securities<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->.
	- Taxes are due for the tax year in which the sale occurred and are calculated according to both federal and state capital gain tax rules. A capital gain is always subject to federal tax rules. State tax rules vary.
- Deductions (above-the-line, standard or itemized) always reduce what portion of income is taxed and at which rates, e.g., retirement account withdrawals, capital gains and social security. Social security is taxed as regular income, but with its own rules for how much of the income is taxed. 
	- See also a web search of [list of federal tax-exempt income united states _current year_](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+of+federal+tax+exempt+income+united+states+_current_year_&sca_esv=1e8c9acc3ca5315c&ei=vqRbZ7KmPNG90PEPp_iz2AM&ved=0ahUKEwiy_cz04aOKAxXRHjQIHSf8DDsQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=list+of+federal+tax+exempt+income+united+states+_current_year_&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiPmxpc3Qgb2YgZmVkZXJhbCB0YXggZXhlbXB0IGluY29tZSB1bml0ZWQgc3RhdGVzIF9jdXJyZW50X3llYXJfSLciUI4IWO8ccAJ4AZABAJgB9wGgAesJqgEFMC44LjG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgOgAokCwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICCBAAGKIEGIkFwgIIEAAYgAQYogTCAgUQABjvBZgDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYIkgcDMS4yoAelKw&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) or have a bot search for other non-taxable income (always confirm with official sources).
	- See also the article from GoCurryCracker! on [avoiding taxes](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/never-pay-taxes-again/) for investors that have a sizeable brokerage account, which basically takes advantage of the 0% tax bracket for capital gain income, and converts pre-tax funds to Roth investments early in retirement by taking advantage of the standard deduction. This strategy is most beneficial for married couples who file jointly. Also note that it takes advantage of the current favorable capital gain tax laws, which like any tax law can be changed if Congress wants to.
- AGI is critical in determining how much tax will be owed on withdrawals from pre-tax retirement accounts, and on the capital gains, interest and dividends earned in taxable brokerage accounts.
	- Sizeable pre-tax retirement accounts are susceptible to large tax bills because of the mandatory withdrawals under RMD rules.
- For deductions, see also [Accounts -> Types](accounts/types.md).<!-- #internal_link -->
	- Contributions to pre-tax retirement accounts and HSAs are above-the-line deductions<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->.
- Sometimes putting everything into perspective to know you are making the best choices can feel a little overwhelming. See a Bogleheads' [overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/t8vqbx/taxable_accounts_101/) on Reddit or the [official page](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Taxable_account) on taxable account investing.
## Fixed Income
There are generally two ways fixed income is taxed:

- Interest is taxed as ordinary income.
- The sale of a fixed income security is treated as a capital gain or loss. The sale of securities is covered under Capital Gains (Financial Assets).

**Examples:**

| **Bond Type**                         | **Federal Taxation**                                                                                                                                     | **State & Local Taxation**                                                                  | **Tax Exemption**                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **U.S. Treasury Bonds**               | Interest taxed as **ordinary income** (same as salary or wages) at federal level.                                                                        | **Exempt** from state and local taxes.                                                      | **Only taxed federally**. No state/local taxes on interest. Great for residents in high-tax states.                                                           |
| **Municipal Bonds (Munis)**           | Interest generally **exempt** from federal taxes.                                                                                                        | Generally **exempt** from state taxes if issued by your state; taxed by other states.       | Generally **exempt from federal tax**. If issued by your state, often exempt from state tax too. Be aware of possible **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** risk. |
| **Corporate Bonds**                   | Interest taxed as **ordinary income** at federal level.                                                                                                  | Taxed at **state** and **local** levels.                                                    | **No tax exemption**. Fully taxed at federal, state, and local levels. Riskier bonds but higher yields.                                                       |
| **U.S. Savings Bonds**                | Interest taxed as **ordinary income** at federal level (unless used for education expenses).                                                             | **Exempt** from state and local taxes.                                                      | **Exempt from state/local taxes**; **federal tax exemption** possible if used for qualifying education expenses.                                              |
| **Municipal Bonds & Social Security** | Interest **does not directly impact** Social Security benefits, but may increase taxable portion of benefits if total income exceeds certain thresholds. | If taxed by your state, this could increase your taxable income, affecting Social Security. | **Does not affect Social Security** benefits directly, but **higher income could increase taxes on Social Security** benefits.                                |
| **Municipal Bonds & AMT**             | Interest from **private activity bonds** may be subject to **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**, even though it's normally exempt from regular federal tax. | Same as federal; taxed by your state if applicable.                                         | **Private activity bonds** can trigger AMT, even if interest is usually tax-exempt. **Check if AMT applies**.                                                 |

## Capital Gains (Financial Assets)
A capital gain is a gross profit on the sale of an investment. The term can be applied to physical assets, such as property, or intangible assets, such as financial securities which is the focus here.
### Securities
The following will focus on the basics of taxing gains on financial securities sold from a taxable brokerage account. For a more detailed breakdown of a scenario unique to you, asking a bot may help get you started, but always make sure to check with current law, and if you have any doubt, check with a financial advisor or certified public accountant. Bots are also useful for preliminary checks to see if something might be an issue. For example, a prompt for an overview search: `are all capital gains in taxable accounts taxed under the same rules` (copy and paste in to [Bing Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)).

Capital gains are taxed at either [short-term or long-term rates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp), i.e. capital invested for a year or less or capital invested for longer than a year, with longer investments given more favorable rates. Federal and state tax rates apply. Tax rates vary by state, with the most common convention being both short and long-term capital gains taxed as ordinary income. See link to [rates](resources/main.md#rates-yields)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> in Resources.

- The sale of a security for a gain in a pre-tax account is not taxed as a capital gain, and is instead taxed like ordinary income upon withdrawal.
#### Calculation
Capital gains (CG) tax [rates](resources/main.md#rates-yields)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> are determined by adjusted gross income (AGI).

- Federal short-term capital gains (STCG) get taxed the same as ordinary income. Therefore, (ordinary income + STCG - deductions) = AGI, and all of it gets taxed progressively at the same rates.
- With federal long-term capital gains (LTCG), the gains are taxed separately after ordinary income, i.e. think of LTCG as income that gets *stacked on top* of ordinary income. Therefore, (ordinary income - deductions + LTCG) = AGI, and each dollar of LTCG that fills each tax bracket after filling them up with ordinary income will be taxed progressively. Here is a great answer to a Reddit post with a [demonstration](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/x04p5i/how_does_capital_gains_tax_work_and_is_it_added/) and a few more [examples explained by a financial advisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RUjyw7Xs2M).
	- According to IRS ordering rules the standard or itemized deduction reduces ordinary income first, which lowers the *stack* of ordinary income and can help put more LTCG into lower LTCG brackets.
- States vary on how short and long-term capitals gains are taxed:
	- Both are taxed at the ordinary income rate, or up to a certain bracket where it gets capped.
	- Different rates for short and long-term gains.
	- No tax on capital gains.
#### Example
The following example will calculate the federal and state capital gain tax using imaginary long-term capital gain tax brackets and deduction for simplicity. If you already viewed the example links above you can skip these examples.

Table 2: Imaginary Federal Capital Gain Tax Owed

- An investor sells shares in taxable brokerage account resulting in $30,000 worth of capital gain and also has $50,000 of ordinary income for the tax year.
- Calculate the federal capital gain tax owed.
- The standard deduction falls into the IRS's ordering rules and reduces ordinary income first.

| Ordinary Income | Capital<br>Gain | AGI = (Ordinary Income <br>+ Capital Gain <br>- Theoretical Deductions)       | CG Tax Bracket #1 ($0 to $40000):<br>Tax Owed | CG Tax Bracket #2 ($40,000 to $500,000):<br>Tax Owed | Total Federal CG Tax Owed |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| $50,000         | $30,000         | ($50,000 +<br> $30,000) -<br>(theoretical deduction of $15,000) = **$65,000** | ($40,000 - $35,000) x 0% = **$0**             | ($65,000 - $40,000) x 10% = **$2500**                | $0 + $2500 = **$2500**    |

Table 3: Imaginary State Capital Gain Tax Brackets

- For the example, the state long-term capital gain tax rates are assumed to be the same as the ordinary income tax rate.

| **Income Range**     | **Ordinary Income Tax Rate** |

| $0 - $9,999          | 2%                           |
| $10,000 - $24,999    | 4%                           |
| $25,000 - $39,999    | 6%                           |
| $40,000 - $59,999    | 8%                           |

#### Dividends
[Dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) are a percentage of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders on a periodic basis, normally quarter-annually. Payments can be cash or additional shares of stock, though payment as more share of stock, i.e. stock dividends are not that common. Not all stocks pay dividends and the ones that do tend to be well established companies. Dividends come in two types: qualified and non-qualified, i.e. ordinary, dividends. The main difference is in how they are taxed.

- [Qualified dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) are given preferential tax treatment and are taxed at long-term capital gain rates, but the underlying stock does not have to be held for a year, only for the holding period, which is 60 days. These characteristics make stocks that pay qualified dividends preferential for taxable accounts. 
- [Non-qualified/ordinary dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp) are taxed as ordinary income.
- [How Are Qualified and Ordinary Dividends Taxed?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/090116/how-are-qualified-and-nonqualified-dividends-taxed.asp) (investopedia.com)
- See also this Bogleheads' [thread](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=423360), particularly the implications of dividends in a taxable account, which when held in significant amounts can affect eligibility for other income dependent services or programs (e.g., ACA health plans, social security).
- See also, [misconceptions about dividend paying stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082015/3-biggest-misconceptions-dividend-stocks.asp), the [Dividend Irrelevance Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendirrelevance.asp)— which effectively proposes that the payout to the investor is actually bad in the long run, since the company is not reinvesting in itself—the opposing argument for well established companies from the short article [The Power of Dividends: You Can't Ignore the Figures](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/power-dividends-cant-ignore-figures-174611045.html), as well as a [discussion on every take](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wi3rk6/are_dividend_stocks_ever_worth_it/) from Reddit, where at least the arguments are rated by an audience of investors. Basically, all that matters is total return after reinvesting dividends.
### ETFs Versus Mutual Funds
Tax efficiency is influenced by how often a fund distributes capital gains, dividends and interest to investors. It is important to research a fund’s history, prospectus, and tax statements to understand how frequently distributions occur and how the fund handles capital gains. Funds that distribute fewer dividends and capital gains, and make the most of tax-advantaged strategies (like tax-loss harvesting) are considered more tax-efficient; however, tax-loss harvesting may not actually be to most investor's advantage after costs are considered. There will be more on that below. A fund's tax burden is reported as its tax cost ratio<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. There is a lot to keep track of and simply using the lowest dividend paying ETF funds is generally the simplest strategy.

- [Tax Efficiency Differences: ETFs vs. Mutual Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/comparing-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-tax-efficiency.asp) (investopedia.com)
- [Is It Always Bad To Hold Mutual Funds In A Taxable Account?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pfdohf/is_it_always_bad_to_hold_mutual_funds_in_a/) (r/Bogleheads)
## Capital Loss
- Capital losses occur when an asset is sold for less than the purchase price.
- Losses may be deducted above-the-line<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> up to annually allowed limit and any leftover carried forward indefinitely.
- Investors conducting tax-loss harvesting<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> need to be familiar with the wash sale rule<!-- #update_with_instant_preview --> and be careful that automatic investing in any of your accounts does not trigger a wash sale.
- For tax reporting, short-term losses get deducted from short-term gains, long-term losses from long-term gains, and then any leftover from either gets deducted from ordinary income.
## Unrealized Capital Gains & Losses
- Prior to the sale of stock, e.g., a share of Ford Motor Co., if the price of the stock has gone up in value since an owner purchased it, this is called an unrealized gain. It becomes a realized gain when the share is sold. No capital gain tax is owed until it becomes a realized gain. Similarly, losses are only realized after the sale of an asset.
- Mutual funds are filled with securities that are bought and sold by fund managers while shareholders own the fund. Therefore, the sale of securities within the fund will result in realized gains and the eventual distribution of earnings to shareholders. This distribution date generally occurs annually near the end of the calendar year and can be found in a fund's prospectus. When this distribution occurs, shareholders who own shares in a taxable account will owe capital gain tax for the tax year that the distribution was received. Fund managers utilize realized losses to cancel out gains. ETFs do not distribute unrealized gains or losses while an investor owns their shares of the fund. Only the realized gain or loss between the original purchase price and sale price of an ETF share is realized, not the trading done within the fund by managers. 
## Alternative Minimum Tax
High income earners are subject to an [additional tax system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp) that calculates a separate total income tax amount. This amount is compared to how much would be owed under the standard system, and the higher of the two is used. 
## Foreign Tax Credit
The U.S. government gives citizens and resident aliens who are required to pay income tax, or a substitute/equivalent of an income tax, to a foreign country or U.S. possession (Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.) the option to [claim a tax credit or itemized deduction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-tax-credit.asp) when filing taxes.
## Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)
High income investors may also be subject to an additional tax based on MAGI. See the Investopedia [article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netinvestmentincome.asp) for details.
## Social Security
Social security is a tax on earned income up to the [wage base limit](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751). However, it is not deductible and income tax is also paid on the taxed amount. Moreover, it is may be partially taxed during retirement, so it is not a very good financial strategy. However, it is mandatory for workers so it is important to understand how to make the most of the options for receiving distributions. See [Accounts -> Types -> Social Security](accounts/types.md#social-security)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> for how it works.

## Tax Harvesting

- Converting a pre-tax retirement account to a Roth account ensures that funds get to remain in the account during the life of the testator and the heirs will not pay tax on withdrawals.
- For taxable brokerage accounts, as long as the current law regarding a basis step-up remains in effect for inherited accounts, the basis values of all financial securities in the account are stepped up to the market value at the date of death (security prices at the close of the market). Therefore, capital gains earned during the life of the testator (the investor who will be passing on their account to an heir), are not subject to tax when withdrawn by the heir per the account value at the time of death. Any capital gain or loss after the date of death is subject to capital gain or loss tax rules.
