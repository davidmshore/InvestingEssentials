## Key Points
- Selling securities for a capital gain or loss **within a tax advantaged account (a pre/post tax retirement account or HSA)** does not trigger a [taxable event](https://www.financestrategists.com/retirement-planning/ira/can-you-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-an-ira/), i.e. no tax is owed on capital gains and no loss may be deducted due to a capital loss.
- **Withdrawals from a pre-tax retirement account** are taxed as ordinary income.
- Selling securities for a profit **within a brokerage account** triggers a taxable event. Capital gains are taxed progressively, and taxed as either short term capital gains (the same federal tax brackets as ordinary income), or long term capital gains (more favorable tax rates) depending on the length of the investment. More on capital gains is covered later.
	- Taxes due are calculated according to both federal and state capital gains tax rules.
- Deductions (above-the-line, standard or itemized) can be important in determining what portion of income is taxed and at which rates, e.g., retirement account withdrawals, capital gains and social security. Social security is taxed as regular income, but with its own rules for how much of the social security income is taxed.

	- See also the article from GoCurryCracker! on [avoiding taxes](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/never-pay-taxes-again/) for investors that have a sizeable brokerage account, which basically takes advantage of the 0% tax bracket for capital gains income, and converts pre-tax accounts to Roth early in retirement taking advantage of the standard deduction. This strategy is most beneficial for married couples who file jointly. Also note that it takes advantage of the current favorable capital gains tax laws, which like any other tax law can be changed if Congress wants to.
- AGI is critical in determining how much tax will be owed on withdrawals from pre-tax retirement accounts and the sale of securities in taxable brokerage accounts.
	- Sizeable pre-tax retirement accounts are susceptible to large tax bills because of the mandatory withdrawals under RMD rules.
- For deductions, see also [Accounts -> Types](accounts/types.md).<!-- #internal_link -->
	- Contributions to pre-tax retirement accounts and HSAs are above-the-line deductions.

## Bonds
Bonds can be taxed in two ways:

- Interest is taxed as ordinary income.
- The sale of a bond for a gain or loss is treated as a capital gain or loss, because certain bonds are a type of security. The sales of securities is covered below under Capital Gains (Financial Assets).

|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **U.S. Treasury Bonds**     | Interest taxed as **ordinary income** (same as salary or wages) at federal level.                     | **Exempt** from state and local taxes.                                         | **Only taxed federally**. No state/local taxes on interest. Great for residents in high-tax states.                           |
| **Municipal Bonds (Munis)** | Interest generally **exempt** from federal taxes.                                                      | **Exempt** from state taxes if issued by your state; taxed by other states.     | **Exempt from federal tax**. If issued by your state, often exempt from state tax too. Be aware of possible **AMT** risk.     |
| **Corporate Bonds**         | Interest taxed as **ordinary income** at federal level.                                                | Taxed at **state** and **local** levels.                                       | **No tax exemption**. Fully taxed at federal, state, and local levels. Riskier bonds but higher yields.                       |
| **U.S. Savings Bonds**      | Interest taxed as **ordinary income** at federal level (unless used for education expenses).          | **Exempt** from state and local taxes.                                         | **Exempt from state/local taxes**; **federal tax exemption** possible if used for qualifying education expenses.              |
| **Municipal Bonds & Social Security** | Interest **does not directly impact** Social Security benefits, but may increase taxable portion of benefits if total income exceeds certain thresholds. | If taxed by your state, this could increase your taxable income, affecting Social Security. | **Does not affect Social Security** benefits directly, but **higher income could increase taxes on Social Security** benefits. |
| **Municipal Bonds & AMT**   | Interest from **private activity bonds** may be subject to **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**, even though it's normally exempt from regular federal tax. | Same as federal; taxed by your state if applicable.                           | **Private activity bonds** can trigger AMT, even if interest is usually tax-exempt. **Check if AMT applies**.                  |

## Capital Gains (Financial Assets)
A capital gain is a gross profit on an investment. The term can be applied to physical assets, such as property, or intangible assets, such as financial securities which is the focus here.
### Securities
The following will focus on the basics of taxing gains on financial securities sold from a taxable brokerage account. For a more detailed breakdown of a scenario unique to you, asking a bot may help get you started, but always make sure to check with current law, and if you have any doubt, check with a financial advisor or certified public accountant. Bots are also useful for preliminary checks to see if something might be an issue. For example, a prompt for an overview search: `are all financial securities capital gains in taxable accounts taxed under the same rules` (copy and paste in to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)).

- Pre-tax retirement account investment gains are not taxed as capital gains, and are instead taxed like ordinary income upon withdrawal.

Capital gains (CG) tax rates are determined based on adjusted gross income (AGI). This is important, because capital gains are taxed progressively. Moreover, capital gains get stacked *on top* of other income, the total of which, after [deductions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/hrqpxd/do_longterm_capital_gains_count_as_income/?rdt=42791), determines the marginal tax rate. Therefore, AGI + CG - deductions determines the highest CG tax bracket, and each portion of CG that fills lower tax brackets (after filling them up with other income) will be taxed progressively.

Capital gains are taxed at either [short term rates and long term rates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp), i.e. capital invested for a year or less or capital invested for longer than a year, with longer investments given more favorable rates. Federal and state tax rates apply. Laws vary by state.
#### Example
The following example will calculate the federal capital gains tax using imaginary capital gains tax brackets and deduction for simplicity.

Table 1: Imaginary Federal Capital Gains Tax Brackets

| **CG Tax Bracket #1**   | **CG Tax Bracket #2**   | **And so on**  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| **$0 - $40,000**         | **$40,000 - $500,000**   | **Etc.**       |
| **Taxed at 0%**          | **Taxed at 10%**         | **Etc.**       |


### Capital Gains Tax Bracket Table (Vertical View)

| **Income Range**   | **CG Tax Rate** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| $0 - $40,000       | 0%              |
| $40,000 - $500,000 | 10%             |
| and so on...       | and so on...    |

| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| $50,000         | $30,000          | ($50,000 +<br> $30,000) -<br>(theoretical deduction of $15,000) = **$65,000** | $40,000 x 0% = **$0**                     | ($65,000 - $40,000) x 10% = **$2500**                | $0 + $2500 = **$2500**    |

Table 3: Imaginary State Capital Gains Tax Brackets

- For the example, the state capital gains tax rates are assumed to be the same as the ordinary income tax rate (which is the most common tax policy among US states).

| **Income Range**     | **Ordinary Income Tax Rate** |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| $0 - $9,999          | 2%                           |
| $10,000 - $24,999    | 4%                           |
| $25,000 - $39,999    | 6%                           |
| $40,000 - $59,999    | 8%                           |
| $60,000 - $100,000   | 10%                          |
| $100,000 - And so on | Etc.                         |

| $50,000             | $30,000           | ($50,000 + $30,000) - $5,000 = **$75,000**                      | $9,999 x 2% = **$199.98**                           | $15,000 x 4% = **$600**                                | $15,000 x 6% = **$900**                                | $20,000 x 8% = **$1,600**                                | $15,000 x 10% = **$1,500**                               | $199.98 + $600 + $900 + $1,600 + $1,500 = **$4,799.98**   |

#### Dividends
[Dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) are a percentage of a company's earnings paid to shareholders on a periodic basis, normally quarter-annually. Payments can be cash or additional shares of stock, though payment as more share of stock, i.e. stock dividends are not that common. Not all stocks pay dividends and the ones that do tend to be well established companies. Dividends come in two types: qualified and non-qualified, i.e. ordinary, dividends. The main difference is in how they are taxed.

- [Qualified dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) are given preferential tax treatment and are taxed at long term capital gains rates rather than ordinary income, but the underlying stock does not have to be held for a year (as would long term capital gains rates to apply to the sale of stock shares), only for the holding period, which is 60 days.
- [Non-qualified/ordinary dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinary-dividends.asp) are taxed as ordinary income.
- [How Are Qualified and Ordinary Dividends Taxed?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/090116/how-are-qualified-and-nonqualified-dividends-taxed.asp) (investopedia.com)
- See also this forum thread, particularly the post from [unwitting_gulag on Sat Feb 03, 2024 4:03 pm](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7693220#p7693220) to understand the implications of dividends in a taxable account, which emphasizes the significance of dividend earnings that can affect eligibility for other income dependent services or programs.  
- See also, [misconceptions about dividend paying stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082015/3-biggest-misconceptions-dividend-stocks.asp), the [Dividend Irrelevance Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendirrelevance.asp)— which effectively proposes that the payout to the investor is actually bad in the long run, since the company is not reinvesting in itself—the opposing argument for well established companies from the short article [The Power of Dividends: You Can't Ignore the Figures](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/power-dividends-cant-ignore-figures-174611045.html), as well as a [discussion on every take](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wi3rk6/are_dividend_stocks_ever_worth_it/) from Reddit, where at least the arguments are rated by a audience of investors.
### ETFs Versus Mutual Funds
- [Tax Efficiency Differences: ETFs vs. Mutual Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/comparing-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-tax-efficiency.asp) (investopedia.com)
- [Is It Always Bad To Hold Mutual Funds In A Taxable Account?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pfdohf/is_it_always_bad_to_hold_mutual_funds_in_a/) (r/Bogleheads)
- Tax efficiency, whether the asset is a mutual fund or an ETF, is influenced by how often the fund distributes long-term and short-term capital gains, as well as the type of assets held within the fund. It is important to research a fund’s history, prospectus, and tax statements to understand how frequently distributions occur and how the fund handles capital gains. Funds that distribute fewer capital gains and make the most of tax-advantaged strategies (like tax-loss harvesting) are considered more tax-efficient.
### Generational Planning
- Converting a pre-tax retirement account to a Roth account ensures that funds get to remain in the account during the life of the testator and the heirs will not pay tax on withdrawals.
- For taxable brokerage accounts, as long as the current law regarding a basis step-up remains in effect for inherited accounts, the basis values of all financial securities in the account are stepped up to the value at the date of death (the price at the close of the market), meaning that capital gains earned during the life of the testator (the investor who will be passing on their account to an heir), are not subject to tax when withdrawn by the heir per the account value at the time of death. Any capital gains or losses after the date of death are subject to capital gains or capital loss tax rules.

	- A key point here is the 10-year rule passed in 2019 that requires inherited retirement accounts to be emptied within 10 years of death.
- Annual gifts up to the [current non-reportable giving limit](https://www.google.com/search?q=current+non-reportable+giving+limit&sca_esv=33eeff773bbaf247&source=hp&ei=L-k3Z7ADzrDQ8Q_RgrywCg&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZzf3P_kxZJMZdneyuiVdsqCvjuOJj-g9&ved=0ahUKEwjw1uWOzt-JAxVOGDQIHVEBD6YQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=current+non-reportable+giving+limit&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IiNjdXJyZW50IG5vbi1yZXBvcnRhYmxlIGdpdmluZyBsaW1pdDIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigAUi1BVBHWEdwAXgAkAEAmAFaoAFaqgEBMbgBA8gBAPgBAvgBAZgCAqACZagCCsICEBAAGAMY5QIY6gIYjAMYjwHCAhMQLhgDGNQCGOUCGOoCGIwDGI8BmAMGkgcBMqAH3gM&sclient=gws-wiz) may be given without reporting to the IRS. These do not count toward the current lifetime cap. There are [caveats](https://www.miestatelawyer.com/blog/gift-tax-why-giving-away-$15,000-is-a-trap) and important [considerations](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/estate-tax-and-lifetime-gifting) when gifting large amounts and a form 709 is required. Consult a financial advisor or CPA before beginning large transfers.
- **It is recommended to consult with an professional advisor before finalizing plans.**
## Social Security
Social security is a tax on earned income up to the [wage base limit](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751). However, it is not deductible and income tax is also paid on the taxed amount. Moreover, it is partially taxed during retirement, so it is not a very good financial strategy. However, it is mandatory for workers so it is important to understand how to make the most of the available options. See [Accounts -> Types -> Social Security](accounts/types.md#social-security)<!-- #internal_anchor_link --> for how it works.
