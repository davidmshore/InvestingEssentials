## Market History & Performance
Every investor will eventually hear that *past performance is not a guarantee of future returns*. While this saying is true and should never be taken lightly regarding individual assets, it is not true of the entire stock market over the course of history. Only the God of Israel [knows the future](https://israelmyglory.org/article/modern-israel-in-biblical-prophecy/), but historic stock market performance can be interpreted as a relatively reliable indicator of the future and should remove fears about losing everything, or receiving a poor return on investment in the long run.

Investment into reputable markets has been shown to be among the safest and most effective ways to build long-term monetary growth when basic diversification rules are followed. How to invest into the market will be covered later, but it is important to understand that it involves owning a fraction of one or more businesses that have offered to allow investors to earn some of the company profits. Companies offer partial ownership by issuing stock shares that can be purchased on a stock market exchange.

History shows that the overall market moves steadily upward regaining even the largest of losses. Part of this relies on a strong underlying economy to prompt more investors. There is more demand as more money enters the market over time, and the other part is due to market's [built-in inflation hedging mechanism](https://www.google.com/search?q=morningstar+why+stocks+are+good+inflation+hedges&source=hp&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZ2fUho9CIrfV5bhsU5261BPaRS9FBcHi&uact=5&oq=morningstar+why+stocks+are+good+inflation+hedges) when used for long-term investing, though this is not to say it does well against [high inflation](https://www.man.com/insights/when-inflation-hits). Basically, companies will outperform inflation over longer time periods so they can remain profitable, and a globally diversified investment strategy is not as likely to be affected by geographically localized hyperinflation. There is a lot more to it than that and you can review a [summary of inflation hedges](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sx3vtd/inflation/) once you have a knowledge of basic terminology and asset function.
### S&P 500 Index 1950-2020
The following graph comes from a Reddit user who wanted to provide reassurance for the inevitable bumps that equities (stock) investors are going to experience. A key point to understand is that an index is a collection of different investments. The S&P 500 Index is a collection of the 500 largest valued companies in the United States. Click to expand, view notes and see the proportions of the logarithmic graph.

- Log graphs display price intervals as percentages and display relative growth better than linear graphs do over a long period.
- The most common style of market graph uses what are called candles. Candles show the price movement for the period represented by each candle. Green candles are increases in price and red are decreases. The tops and bottoms of the solid part of each candle represent the start and end (opening and closing) prices for the period, in this case 3 months per candle. The lines extending above and below the solid part of the candles are called wicks, which represent the highest and lowest prices reached during the period.
- Understanding the details of this chart is not as important as the overall message it gives to long-term investors: the market has averaged a steady compound annual growth rate despite the fluctuations and market crashes.

	- To see the present day chart on [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=SP%3ASPX), set the interval to *All* and the scale to *Logarithmic* (default Log 10) in the settings icon on the bottom right of the chart or using the keyboard shortcut Alt+L or Option+L.
- This is an interesting [introductory discussion on market value](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15mqzsv/the_reason_why_the_stock_market_always_is_over/) from Reddit. That and the following discussions are not important to focus on while learning how to invest, but they may answer questions that come to mind about the market.

- There are many more indexes to invest in other than the U.S. S&P 500, including options to invest in every sub-category of the U.S. market or even the world. These are called total market funds and perform similarly over the long run. The theoretical advantage of a world fund is that the economy of one or more countries should improve when another's declines and an investor will never miss the start of the next bull run no matter where it occurs<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->. A bull run is a increase in the rate of return above the average stock market return and generally occurs for a relatively short period of time. It can reference an individual company stock, an index, or the entire market. A longer term pattern of steady upward stock market returns that is closer to the historical average rate of return is called a bull market. The opposites of a bull market and bull run are called a bear market and bear run.
### Compounding Examples
The significance of a steady long-term rate of return relates to the principle of compounding. Using this [calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/investment-calculator), what is the gross maturity value (an investment's future value without subtracting taxes or fees) of a $1000 investment after 20 years, earning the estimated 8.22% annual return shown in the graph, compounded annually without making any monthly contributions? What about 25 years? Without adding any more money to the account, look what happens to the original investment. That is the advantage of compounding *(while compounding does not occur in the market at a steady rate from year to year as it does in a savings account, the increase in value of equities and the reinvested dividends over time act as an interest payment to an investor; dividends are periodic payments to shareholders as a way to share profits with investors without having to sell shares of stock. Dividends must be reinvested to maximize the performance gains of the stock market)*.

- Now what if after the investing $1000, you contribute $100 monthly for the duration of 30 years (a total of $37,000 invested)?
- What about when it is $200 every month (a total of $73,000 invested)?
- Now compare this to a high yield savings account interest rate, assuming a 5.00% annual rate of return. How would this change the gross maturity value if all of the investment capital was placed into the best savings account instead of invested into the market?
	- Notice that a seemingly small percentage difference makes a big monetary difference when it comes to compounding over a long period of time. The difference becomes even greater as the investment period increases.
	- Without contributing any money to the initial $1000 investment, observe the difference using the two rates (5.00% and 8.22%) at 20, 30, and 40 year periods.
- This is the importance of living according to a budget, beginning investing as early as possible, and having an investing mindset, i.e. being on the lookout for the how to invest in whatever it may be with the highest return on investment (ROI).
## When to Buy?
The temptation to time the market can be avoided by dollar-cost averaging<!-- #update_with_instant_preview -->, which is simply setting a routine deposit schedule and investment amount. This is the easiest strategy for maintaining discipline and gives the added emotional benefit of not having to worry about entering the market at the wrong time. As mentioned in [Budgeting](budgeting.md)<!-- #internal_link -->, this amount should increase over time as you earn more to account for inflation, prepare for unexpected costs before or during retirement, and provide a larger cushion of retirement income or allow for early retirement.

For those sitting on a pile of cash and looking to invest, the difference in the amount earned between investing the entire lump sum versus dollar-cost averaging is not as big as many people may think, but the ratio by which lump sum investing beats dollar-cost averaging over a 10+ year period is about 2:1. This has been shown to be true for any 10-year period starting in any month of the year since 1926.

- Opinion: it may make sense to at least pay attention to what is going on with the economy, as there may be indicators of a drop or continued drop in market to make the most of a buy-in if the economy is *currently* being affected by global catastrophe. However, it is important to note that even during World War II, the largest U.S. companies' stock prices rose about 50%, before continuing on into one of the best bull markets is U.S. history. This would have been largely expected at the time as the U.S. was the largest economic power in the world not ravaged by the war.

[Recessions are inevitable](https://get.ycharts.com/resources/blog/inverted-yield-curve-what-it-means-and-how-to-navigate-it/), and the average annual market drawdown of the U.S. stock market since 1980 has been about 14%. The caveat is that this is the average, and timing the market is considered virtually impossible. A drop may only come after years of a rising market and a decline may not drop low enough to reach the price level before the rise began where an investor could have bought-in at a lower price, accumulated overall better returns, and saved themselves the time and energy of watching and wondering. The most eye-opening realization for hesitant investors may be the similarity between [good timing versus bad timing](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/does-market-timing-work) compared to not investing at all. Here is one more chart on [the downside of missing the best days in the market](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/practice-management/client-conversations/managing-volatility/timing-the-market-is-impossible.html).
## Realistic Expectations
Notice that a steady rate of return was used in the examples, which was the market average over the period shown on the graph. Also remember that to receive the highest rate of return, dividends must be reinvested. In real life, an individual investor does not always have time to wait out the crashes which can take years to recover. Therefore, depending on how much an investor is able to accumulate for retirement and their financial goals, owning diversified financial assets and shifting an increasingly larger portion of them to lower risk, lower reward assets as an investor gets closer to retirement is important to maintaining the longevity of a predictable lifestyle.

Still, by taking advantage of the relatively safe, higher rate of return that the stock market offers across decades of time, and slowly reducing this rate of return through less risky interest earning assets, investors can end up with a satisfying return on investment. Since the 1920s the average annual stock market return unadjusted for inflation has been about 10% and the average annual bond market return has been about 6%.

- To simulate how equity investment would have performed throughout previous recessions use this [calculator](https://compoundwave.com/calculator/index-returns?initialInvestment=500&montlyContributions=100&yearlyContributionIncrease=0&fromDate=2015-01-01&toDate=2025-01-01&Assets=sp500&Assets=sp500wd&Assets=ndx&Assets=dji). Observe the difference in recovery time and ending values for the S&P index. Choose a starting point prior to a recession, an imaginary investment value of your choosing, and run the following scenarios:
	- Stop investing at the bottom of the recession and wait for recovery.
	- Continually dollar-cost average without dividend reinvestment.
	- Continually dollar-cost average with dividend reinvestment.
	- Try changing the starting point to the peak of a recession.
