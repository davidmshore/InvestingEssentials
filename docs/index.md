# Welcome to Investing Essentials
This website is comprised of basic investing knowledge that caters to uninitiated and hesitant investors. The aim is to provide a brief introduction to the financial markets, tax-wise investing, and the confidence to begin putting hard earned money to work through compounding. Additionally, there are links to [resources](resources/main.md)<!-- #internal_link --> such as financial planning [tools](resources/tools.md)<!-- #internal_link --> and many more experienced investors to learn from as well.

Since I started with the Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue gaining a more comprehensive education on the topics introduced here. While the fundamentals of account usage, asset allocation, tax efficiency and minimizing investment expenses may be similar for non-US investors, the ways, means and reference material are US focused. Bogleheads.org provides guidance for [non-US residents](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Category:Non-US_domiciles) and [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) contains a comprehensive list of [regional links](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/country_index/) plus a few [money path flowcharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version).
