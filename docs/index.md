# Welcome to Investing Essentials
This website is comprised of investing information that began as a personal reference project, and was expanded to provide uninitiated and hesitant investors with the confidence to begin letting their money work for them in the financial markets. There are linked [resources](resources/main.md)<!-- #internal_link --> to many more experienced investors to learn from as well. 

Since I started with the Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue learning. While this site's content covering the fundamentals of assets allocation, tax efficient investing and keeping expenses to a minimum may be similar for non-US investors, the investment vehicles and reference material are US focused. The Bogleheads' website offers guidance for [non-US residents](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Category:Non-US_domiciles) and [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) contains some country and regional specific [content](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version) as well as a comprehensive list of [links](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/country_index/).
