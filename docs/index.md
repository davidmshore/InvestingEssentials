This website is comprised of investing information that began as a personal reference project, and was expanded to provide uninitiated and hesitant investors with the confidence to begin letting their money work for them in the stock market. There are linked [resources](resources/main.md){ data-preview }<!-- #internal_link --> to many (better) educated investors to learn from as well. 

Since I started with the Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue learning after leaving here. Their website is one of the few sources I have come across that provides comprehensive guidance for non-US residents, who will not be able to use much of the reference material found throughout this site. However, the fundamentals of using assets and investment accounts that offer tax advantages and keeping expenses to a minimum will be similar. The [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) subreddit is another recommended resource.
