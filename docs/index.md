This website consists of financial investing information that began as a personal reference, and was expanded to give the uninitiated and hesitant investor the basics to build confidence to begin letting their money work for them in the stock market. There are linked [resources](resources/main.md){ data-preview }<!-- #internal_link --> to many (better) educated investors to learn from as well. 

Since I started with the Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue learning after here. The website is one of the few sources I have come across that provides comprehensive guidance for non-US residents, who will not be able to use much of the reference material found throughout this site. However, the basics of capitalizing on your access to your financial markets, using assets and investment accounts that offer tax advantages, and keeping expenses to a minimum will be similar. The [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) subreddit is another recommended resource.
