# Welcome to Investing Essentials
This website is comprised of investing information that began as a personal reference project, and was expanded to provide uninitiated and hesitant investors with the confidence to begin letting their money work for them in the stock market. There are linked [resources](resources/main.md)<!-- #internal_link --> to many more experienced investors to learn from as well. 

Since I started with the Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue learning. Their website also gives guidance for non-US residents. While the fundamentals of assets allocation, tax efficient investing and keeping expenses to a minimum will be similar, the investment vehicles and reference material found throughout this site are for US investors. The [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) subreddit is another recommended resource.
