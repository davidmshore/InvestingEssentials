# Welcome to Investing Essentials
Here you will find foundational investing knowledge that focuses on utilizing the financial markets. After an overview of principles of financial growth, including budgeting, market history, tax-wise investment vehicles and strategies, and building an investment portfolio, readers should have the confidence to begin putting hard earned money to work through compounding. Additionally, there are links to [resources](resources/main.md),<!-- #internal_link --> such as financial planning [tools](resources/tools.md)<!-- #internal_link --> and many more experienced investors to learn from as well.

Since I started with the Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue gaining a more comprehensive education on the topics introduced here. While the fundamentals of account usage, asset allocation, tax efficiency and minimizing investment expenses may be similar for non-US investors, the ways, means and reference material are US focused. Bogleheads.org provides guidance for [non-US residents](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Category:Non-US_domiciles) and [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) contains a comprehensive list of [regional links](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/country_index/) plus a few [money path flowcharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version).
