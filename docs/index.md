# Welcome to Investing Essentials
Here you will find foundational investment knowledge that focuses on utilizing the financial markets through long-term, diversified, low cost index fund investing. After an overview of principles of financial growth, including budgeting, market history, tax-wise investment vehicles and strategies, assets, and how to build an investment portfolio, you should have the confidence to begin putting your hard earned money to work through compounding. Additionally, there are links to [resources](resources/main.md),<!-- #internal_link --> such as financial planning [tools](resources/tools.md)<!-- #internal_link --> and many more experienced investors to learn from as well.

Since this website is essentially a concise collection of the fundamental methods used by Bogleheads, I recommend their [website](https://www.bogleheads.org/index.php) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/?rdt=35841) as two of the best places to continue gaining a more comprehensive education on the topics introduced here. Alternatively you can start with the [book](resources/main.md#digital-and-audiobooks)<!-- #internal_anchor_link -->, and simply use this site as an easily searchable reference guide or repository of resources. While the fundamentals of account usage, asset allocation, tax efficiency and minimizing investment expenses may be similar for non-US investors, the ways, means, taxation rules, and reference material are U.S. focused. Bogleheads.org provides guidance for [non-US residents](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Category:Non-US_domiciles) and [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/) contains a comprehensive list of [regional links](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/country_index/) plus a few [money path flowcharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/#wiki_graphical_version).

History shows that consistent successful investing requires utilizing long-term time horizons. The time to start learning is now.
